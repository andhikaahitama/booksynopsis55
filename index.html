Faced with a shortage of manpower in armaments factories, the Third Reich sent concentration camp prisoners to work as slaves. While the genocide of the Jews and the Gypsies continued at extermination camps, numerous outside "Kommandos" were set up in the vicinity of the large concentration camps. The Dora Camp, located in the center of Germany, was one of the most notorious. Originally a mere Kommando attached to Buchenwald, it became one of the largest Nazi concentration camps. There prisoners were put to work in a huge underground factory, building V-2 rockets, the secret weapon developed by German scientists in an attempt to reverse the course of the war, under the direction of Wernher von Braun. In this dispassionate but powerful account, Andr� Sellier, himself a former prisoner at Dora, tells the dramatic story of the camp, the tunnel factory, and the underground work sites. He has utilized all available documents as well as unpublished testimony from several dozen fellow prisoners. He recounts the horrors of everyday life at Dora&#x2014;prisoners dying by the hundreds and indescribable suffering&#x2014;and the murderous "evacuation" of the camp by railroad convoys and death marches, which took place in early 1945 and led to the death of thousands of prisoners. Illustrated with 20 pages of photographs and drawings, and 24 maps.</p><p>The author, himself a former prisoner at Dora, tells the dramatic story of the camp, the factory, and the underground work sites.

In the fifteen years before the Civil War, when 400,000 pioneers used the trail to emigrate West--scholars still regard this as the largest land migration in history--it united the coasts, doubled the size of the country, and laid the groundwork for the railroads. Today, amazingly, the trail is all but forgotten.<br><br> Rinker Buck is no stranger to grand adventures. His first travel narrative, Flight of Passage, was hailed by The New Yorker as "a funny, cocky gem of a book," and with The Oregon Trail he brings the most important route in American history back to glorious and vibrant life.<br><br>Traveling from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Baker City, Oregon, over the course of four months, Buck is accompanied by three cantankerous mules, his boisterous brother, Nick, and an "incurably filthy" Jack Russell terrier named Olive Oyl. Along the way, they dodge thunderstorms in Nebraska, chase runaway mules across the Wyoming plains, scout more than five hundred miles of nearly vanished trail on foot, cross the Rockies, and make desperate fifty-mile forced marches for water. The Buck brothers repair so many broken wheels and axels that they nearly reinvent the art of wagon travel itself. They also must reckon with the ghost of their father, an eccentric yet loveable dreamer whose memory inspired their journey across the plains and whose premature death, many years earlier, has haunted them both ever since.<br><br>But The Oregon Trail is much more than an epic adventure. It is also a lively and essential work of history that shatters the comforting myths about the trail years passed down by generations of Americans. Buck introduces readers to the largely forgotten roles played by trailblazing evangelists, friendly Indian tribes, female pioneers, bumbling U.S. Army cavalrymen, and the scam artists who flocked to the frontier to fleece the overland emigrants. Generous portions of the book are devoted to the history of old and appealing things like the mule and the wagon. We also learn how the trail accelerated American economic development. Most arresting, perhaps, are the stories of the pioneers themselves--ordinary families whose extraordinary courage and sacrifice made this country what it became.<br><br>At once a majestic journey across the West, a significant work of history, and a moving personal saga, The Oregon Trail draws readers into the journey of a lifetime. It is a wildly ambitious work of nonfiction from a true American original. It is a book with a heart as big as the country it crosses.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2015:</strong> Well into middle-age, Rinker Buck found himself divorced, at the edge of bankruptcy, and growing blunt through the twin demons of ennui and alcohol. This was not a state he was accustomed to; instilled by his father with a sense of daring, Buck was no stranger to adventure, having been (with his brother) one half of the youngest duo to fly across the country, a tale documented in his celebrated book, <em>Flight of Passage</em>. On a whim, he found himself in a museum at the head of the Oregon Trail, realizing that even as a fairly serious American history buff, he knew virtually nothing about the pivotal era when 400,000 pioneers made their way West in quests for land, gold, and new lives. On a much bigger whim, Buck decided to travel the 2,000 miles of ruts and superseding highways in a mule-driven wagon on his own &#x201c;crazyass&#x201d; quest for a new beginning. The result is a dense-yet-entertaining mix of memoir, history and adventure, as Buck-- joined by another brother, Nick, and his &#x201c;incurably filthy&#x201d; dog, Olive Oyl--struggle with the mechanical, environmental, and existential challenges posed by such an unusually grueling journey. Buck is an engaging writer, and while the book pushes 500 pages, the story never lags. By the end, you&#x2019;ll know more about mules than you ever thought you would (just enough, actually), and you&#x2019;ll have a better perspective on the Trail, its travelers, and the role it played in shaping the modern United States. (And is Rinker Buck not a pioneer-worthy name for an tale such as this?)<em>--Jon Foro</em></p>A01</p><h2>Hans-Peter Feldmann: Voyeur 6</h2><p>This sixth volume in Hans-Peter Feldmann&#39;s (born 1941) ongoing, much-loved and now-classic artist&#39;s book series offers a chaotic compendium of movie stills, photojournalism, ads, amateur photos, pornography, art, scientific imagery, archival imagery, found photographs and much else, dipping into the iconographic whirlpool of our times and bringing up a world both familiar and incongruous. From the very first page (there is no title page), Feldmann&#39;s carefully composed sequencing and design invites the reader to interpret the black-and-white photographs as a narrative--something that is only intermittently possible, but compelling and almost inevitable--like a photo book in comic-book form. Most of the images include faces, and occasionally, familiar figures such as Mohammed Ali, Isabella Rossellini or Henry Miller loom out from the image continuum, among those whose anonymity endows the book with a sense of vast scale and reach, as if traversing the entire history of photography.</p><p></p><h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2><p>This book is in very good condition and the book was read once.

But the trail to Ettinger&#39;s true murderer is twisted, dark and dangerous...and even colder than the almost decade-old corpse the p.i. is determined to avenge.</p><p>Lawrence Block is a four-time winner of the Edgar Award and was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America. He has also won four Shamus Awards, and was the first recipient of the Nero Wolfe Award. He is the author of over 40 books, many of which feature the characters Bernie Rhodenbarr, Matthew Scudder, Chip Harrison, and Evan Tanner. He lives in New York City with his wife Lynne.Though Roberts is an expressive, earnest narrator, fans of Block&#39;s endlessly satisfying Matthew Scudder mysteries will find the tone of this reading somehow off. Block&#39;s writing is understated and restrained, reflecting his hero&#39;s resigned acceptance of humankind&#39;s darker nature. Scudder is not surprised by the failings of people, including himself. Roberts&#39;s reading is showy, infused with an incredulity that is simply not in keeping with Scudder&#39;s informed fatalism. Still, this is a Scudder mystery, and listeners will enjoy his relentless investigation into the brutal nine-year-old murder of a pregnant woman. The novel is early in the Scudder series, by the way, and an important stepping-stone on his way to sobriety. M.O.

In fighting numerous skirmishes, liberating hundreds of slaves, burning portions of four towns, and murdering half a dozen men, Lane and his brigade garnered national attention as the saviors of Kansas and the terror of Missouri.</p><p>This first book-length study of the &#x201c;jayhawkers,&#x201d; as the men of Lane&#x2019;s brigade were known, takes a fresh look at their exploits and notoriety. Bryce Benedict draws on a wealth of previously unexploited sources, including letters by brigade members, to dramatically re-create the violence along the Kansas-Missouri border and challenge some of the time-honored depictions of Lane&#x2019;s unit as bloodthirsty and indiscriminately violent.</p><p>Bringing to life an era of guerillas, bushwhackers, and slave stealers, <i>Jayhawkers</i> also describes how Lane&#x2019;s brigade was organized and equipped and provides details regarding staff and casualties. Assessing the extent to which the jayhawkers followed accepted rules of warfare, Benedict argues that Lane set a precedent for the Union Army&#x2019;s eventual adoption of &#x201c;hard&#x201d; tactics toward civilians.</p><p>An entertaining story rich in detail, <i>Jayhawkers</i> will captivate scholars and history enthusiasts as it sheds new light on the unfettered violence on this western fringe of the Civil War.</p></p><p><b>Bryce Benedict</b> served for twenty-one years in the U.S. Army and Kansas National Guard and is now lead defense counsel for the Kansas State Self Insurance Fund.

We didn't have any doubt that that was where we were going, and we were, boy, <i>ready</i>. We had been months and months in the captivity of a weird alien creature from another world, the one we called Dopey. He was alien, all right. He looked sort of like a large chicken with a kitten's face and a peacock's tail, and he had kidnapped the lot of us--snatched us right out of the old Starlab astronomical satellite and thrown us into some kind of space-traveling machine that whisked us from <i>here</i> to some unbelievably distant <i>there</i> in no time at all. And <i>there</i> was where Dopey kept us, in one damn miserably uncomfortable prison or another, on this unpleasant planet we had never heard of before.<br>That was a truly nasty experience, but, the way it looked to us at the time, it was <i>over</i>! Against the odds, we had escaped! Our chance to get away came when some rival gang of nonhumans, these ones called the "Horch," invaded our prison planet. In the confusion we fought our way to the matter-transmitter thing, and jumped in, and were on our way home. I was the last to climb into the machine....<br>And I saw the pale lavender flash that meant it was working....<br>And I came our again....<br>But I wasn't home at all. The place I was in didn't look at all like Starlab. A pair of those silvery-spidery Horch wheeled fighting machines that had been trying to kill us were standing there, not half a dozen meters away. This time they weren't shooting at me, though. If they had been, I couldn't have shot back, because something I couldn't see grabbed me behind--no, <i>enveloped</i><br>me, in an all-points hug that didn't let me move a muscle--as I heard the machine's door open again.<br>Dopey spilled out on top of me, plume all ruffled, little cat eyes glaring around in terror. He took one look at the machines and began to shake. Something hard and painful was pressing behind my right ear. I managed to yell a question at Dopey; and just before the lights went out he sobbed in answer: "Agent Dannerman, we are in the hands of the Horch."<br>And that was the nastiest, the very nastiest, moment of all.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1996 by Frederik Pohl</p><h2>The Mapping of America</h2><p>The development of cartography and the geography, territorial expansion, and demographic, political, scientific, and industrial growth of North America are recorded in maps from the sixteenth century to the present</p><p></p><h2>Education Automation: Freeing the scholar to return to his studies</h2><p>In a perceptive and penetrating essay devoted ot a definition of the modern world as he sees it, the world-reknowned inventor of the Geodesic dome discusses the place of education in that world.

Poet Simon Ortiz had honored those people seventeen years earlier in his own way. That book, "from Sand Creek," is now back in print. Originally published in a small-press edition, "from Sand Creek" makes a large statement about injustices done to Native peoples in the name of Manifest Destiny. It also makes poignant reference to the spread of that ambition in other parts of the world--notably in Vietnam--as Ortiz asks himself what it is to be an American, a U.S. citizen, and an Indian. Indian people have often felt they have had no part in history, Ortiz observes, and through his work he shows how they can come to terms with this feeling. He invites Indian people to examine the process they have experienced as victims, subjects, and expendable resources--and asks people of European heritage to consider the motives that drive their own history and create their own form of victimization. Through the pages of this sobering work, Ortiz offers a new perspective on history and on America. Perhaps more important, he offers a breath of hope that our peoples might learn from each other: <br> "This America<br> has been a burden<br> of steel and mad<br> death, <br> but, look now, <br> there are flowers<br> and new grass<br> and a spring wind<br> rising<br> from Sand Creek."Poet, fiction writer, essayist, and storyteller <b>Simon Ortiz</b> is a native of Acoma Pueblo and is the author of numerous books.</p><h2>The Death of a King: A Medieval Mystery</h2><p>In 1344, as royal clerk Edmund Beche carries out his official investigation into the murder, seventeen years earlier, of King Edward II, he himself becomes a target for murder</p><p>Paul Doherty was born in Middlesbrough (North-Eastern England). He went to Liverpool University and then worked in Ascot, Nottingham and Crawley West Sussex before being appointed as Headmaster to Trinity Catholic. Paul&#39;s other incarnation is as a novelist. He finished his doctorate on the reign of Edward II of England and, in 1987, began to publish a series of outstanding historical mysteries set in the Middle Age, Classical, Greek, Ancient Egypt and elsewhere. He has been published under several pseudonyms: C. L. Grace, Paul Harding, Ann Dukthas and Anna Apostolou but now writes only under his own name. He has also written several non-fiction titles.Paul lectures for a number of organisations, particularly on historical mysteries, many of which later feature in his writings. Paul and his wife, Carla, live on the borders of London and Essex.Doherty's first novel, nothing less than a tour de force, draws the reader into England in 1344, 17 years after the overthrow of King Edward II. A dreadful series of events is chronicled in the letters of a clerk, Edmund Beche, ordered by Edward II to investigate his father's murder and to reveal nothing of what he learns except to his sovereign. Beche, however, confides the account of his odyssey to a trusted friend, prior of a great abbey, as "security in the event of my disappearance or trial for treason." The clerk's fears are well-founded. Assassins dog his steps during his journeys in search fo evidence that Edward II was the victim of his adulterous queen and her paramour. The assignment takes Beche from England to France and Rome where he survives lethal attacks and uncovers an astounding truth not only about the betrayed monarch but about traitors among the English royalty. Beautifully written and thoroughly researched, the novel compels belief and rouses admiration for the author.

It was easy for your thoughts to drift when you were doing something you did every day&#x2014;such as driving down the Tlokweng Road, or spooning tea into the teapot while you waited for the kettle to boil, or standing in your garden look�ing up at the wide sky of Botswana. These were all activities that did not require total and undivided concentration, although her hus�band, that great <i>garagiste, </i>Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, stressed that driving demanded your whole attention. Mma Ramotswe, though, felt it was perfectly possible to drive carefully and yet at the same time let the mind wander. There was not a driver in the country, she imagined, who did not think of other things while driving&#x2014;unless of course there were, somewhere or other, people who had nothing at all to think about.<br>&nbsp;<br>That morning she thought of what she would cook for din�ner. She thought of letters she might receive and of the replies she should write. She thought of how she knew this road so well that she could drive it blindfold if necessary, and still get to her desti�nation unscathed, or largely unscathed. She thought of how month by month, year by year, the traffic had got worse, as traffic always seemed to do. Was there nowhere on this earth where traffic got better; where the lines of cars thinned; where one could park virtually anywhere, as one could in the old days? And she thought of the people in her life, the people she would see that day, and the people she would not.<br>&nbsp;<br>The people in her life . . . These, she felt, were of two sorts. Whatever further classifications might suggest themselves, at the outset people could be divided into those who were late and those who were still with us. The ranks of the late were legion, but each of us had a small number of late people who meant something special to us and whom we would always remember. She had never known her mother, who had died when she was still an infant, but her father, Obed Ramotswe, she had known well and still missed as much as ever. Every day she thought of him, of his kindness and his wisdom, of his ability to judge cattle&#x2014;and men&#x2014;with such a perceptive eye; of the love he had borne for her and of how his passing had been like the putting out of the sun itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were other late people, of course: there was Seretse Khama, first President of Botswana and patriot; there was Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s brother, Richard, who had been called to higher things&#x2014;as Mma Makutsi put it&#x2014;from his bed of sickness; there was her favourite aunt, whose cheerful and irreverent remarks had been a source of such joy; there was that unfortunate man in Mochudi who had stepped on a cobra; there were so many others.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the group of late people. Then there was the other group, made up of those who were not late; who were, in some cases, only too obviously present, who touched her life in some way or other. These were her family, her friends, her colleagues, and finally those who were neither friends nor colleagues.<br>&nbsp;<br>She considered herself blessed with her family. Some people had family members who were always burdensome, who wanted things, who found fault, who complained about this, that, and the next thing. Or they had family members who were an embarrassment&#x2014;who prompted the making of comments such as, &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s not all that close a relative&#x2014;very distant, in fact,&#x201d; or even, &#x201c;We have the same name, yes, but I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re related.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>She had no need to say any of that. She had a fine husband, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. She had various aunts in villages outside Gaborone, she had several cousins whom she always enjoyed seeing; and of course she had the two children, Motholeli and Puso, who, although technically foster children, were considered by everybody, including Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, to be her own. She had lost a baby&#x2014;but that had been a long time ago, and in so far as one could ever get over such a thing, she had done so. She could now think of that baby without being overwhelmed by sorrow; she could think of the brief moment during which she had held her child, that tiny scrap of humanity, and of the inexpressible, overwhelming love she had felt. She could think of that now without her heart becoming a cold stone within her. <br>&nbsp;<br>To start with friends: prominent among these was Mma Sylvia Potokwane, matron and stout defender&#x2014;in every sense&#x2014;of the orphans entrusted to her care. Mma Ramotswe had known Mma Potokwane for many years and their friendship had been firm throughout, although she could not recall when, and in what circumstances, they had first met. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But you must remember where you met her first,&#x201d; said Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. &#x201c;She is not one of those people one could easily forget.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That was, of course, true: Mma Potokwane was certainly not easily forgotten, but still Mma Ramotswe could not remember any occasion when somebody had said, &#x201c;Mma Ramotswe, this is Mma Potokwane.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I really do not remember, Rra,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I just feel that we have known one another forever. She has always been there&#x2014;like Kgali Hill or the Limpopo River. Do you remember the first time you saw Kgali Hill?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s quite different, Mma,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t compare Mma Potokwane to Kgali Hill.&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe considered this, and the more she thought about it, the more she felt that one <i>could </i>compare the redoubtable matron to Kgali Hill. Both were solid; both were unchanging; both would not be budged from where they stood. <br>&nbsp;<br>Of course there were other friends&#x2014;Mma Ramotswe was well known in Gaborone and could rarely make a trip to the shops without bumping into somebody she knew, and most of these would be friends of one sort or another. There were old friends whom she had known all her life&#x2014;people with whom she had grown up in Mochudi&#x2014;and there were newer friends, those whom she had met during her years in Gaborone: neighbours, friends of friends, fellow attenders at the Anglican Cathedral, members of the Botswana Ladies&#x2019; Winter Blanket Committee. This last group met in the months immediately preceding winter and planned fundraising events for their annual blanket appeal. People forgot that Botswana had a winter and that there would be people, poor people, who felt the cold. Just because a country was drenched in sunlight did not mean that the temperature could not drop when the sun went down, especially on the fringes of the Kalahari. On a winter night, with the sky clear and filled with white fields of stars, the cold might penetrate to your very bones, as a dry cold can so easily do. And that was when you needed blankets to wrap yourself in, to make a cocoon of warmth to see you through to the morning. <br>&nbsp;<br>So there were the ladies of the Blanket Committee, and they were all her good friends, as were the ladies who attended to her at the supermarket bakery and who always kept the freshest bread for Mma Ramotswe, even though she protested that she did not want any special treatment and would take her chances like anybody else. Then there was the man in the Vehicle Licensing Department who invariably clapped his hands with delight when Mma Ramotswe came in to attend to business on behalf of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and who would shout out, &#x201c;My favourite lady has just come into the office! Oh, this is a very happy day for the Vehicle Licensing Department!&#x201d; That had embarrassed her at first, but she had become accustomed to it and took it in her stride, laughing along with her admirer&#x2019;s col�leagues. She realized that if you worked in the Vehicle Licensing Department, then you might need your moments of levity, and if she could provide those just by stepping in through the door, then she was happy to do so.<br>&nbsp;<br>Friends were different from colleagues, of course, although col�leagues could also be friends. Being self- employed, Mma Ramotswe did not have a large number of colleagues; in fact, she only had one full- time, permanent colleague, so to speak, although she had a part- time colleague in the shape of Mr. Polopetsi and another, if one took a liberal view of the definition, in the shape of Charlie. Fanwell, the former apprentice and now assistant mechanic, was not really a col�league in the strict sense, as he worked in the adjacent garage owned by Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s husband and was really Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s colleague rather than hers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The full- time colleague was, as everybody knew, Mma Makutsi&#x2014;Grace Makutsi, former secretary, graduate <i>magna cum laude </i>of the Botswana Secretarial College, where she achieved the mark of ninety- seven per cent in the final examinations; born in the remote and unexceptional town of Bobonong; survivor . . . Yes, Mma Makutsi had every right to be called a survivor. She had survived poverty; she had survived the battle for an education; she had lived with a slightly difficult skin and with the necessity of large spectacles; she had struggled for everything she possessed; and at last her ship had come home, unambiguously and magnificently, when she had met and married Mr. Phuti Radiphuti, a kind man, and a wealthy one too, being the proprietor of the Double Comfort Furniture Store. And together they had had a baby, Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti, a fine young son, and the only purring baby in Botswana.<br><br>That was Mma Makutsi, and Mma Ramotswe, thinking of her now, could only smile at her ways, which were well known, and per�fectly tolerable once you became used to them. Mr. Polopetsi, her part- time colleague, was in awe of Mma Makutsi. He was a very mild man, a chemist with a chequered career, who worked in the agency on a voluntary basis because he needed something to do. He had now found a job as a part- time chemistry teacher at Gaborone Secondary School, a job that brought in very little money as it rarely required more than a few hours of his time each week. But the pay did not matter: his wife, a senior civil servant, was the main breadwinner. She preferred her husband to be occupied, and so was happy for him to spend his time on his poorly paid teaching job and his unpaid detective work in the agency.<br><br>And it suited the agency too. &#x201c;Mr. Polopetsi may not be a great detective,&#x201d; observed Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;But he does understand the sci�entific method and the need for evidence. That is important, Mma Ramotswe.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie, by contrast, understood very little&#x2014;at least in Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s view. He had been an apprentice in the garage, but had lost his job when Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni had been obliged to cut staff. That had been done only when all other avenues had been explored; money was tight, and many cars were now being taken to the larger garages where their complicated needs could be addressed by spe�cialist equipment.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They are not making cars for people any longer,&#x201d; said Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. &#x201c;They are making them for computers. If something goes wrong, they just take out the part and throw it away. Nobody can fix anything these days.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Charlie had his faults. He was impetuous, being given to mak�ing inflammatory remarks in the presence of Mma Makutsi, and his thoughts seemed to dwell almost exclusively on girls. In spite of all this, though, Mma Ramotswe had been unwilling to see him cast adrift and had employed him in the agency as what Mma Makutsi insisted on calling a Junior Probationary Apprentice Detective. Her insistence on this humiliating title rankled with Charlie, but he was grateful for such scraps of status as the job gave him, and even Mma Makutsi had to admit that he was making an effort. There was a long way to go, though, and she was watching him. Those, then, were the categories of friends and colleagues. That left those who were neither friends nor colleagues, a group that in turn was divided into those who were simply unknown&#x2014;people who clearly existed but who had yet to be met&#x2014;and those who were known. It was this last set that was most delicate and troublesome, as it embraced those whom some might assume were enemies. That was not a word that Mma Ramotswe liked. She did not think of others in this way, as from an early age she had been imbued with the message that one should love one&#x2019;s enemies, and if one loved one&#x2019;s enemies then surely they ceased to be enemies. That message of love had been taught at Sunday School in Mochudi, when, along with thirty other children, the young Precious Ramotswe had been taught to recite the precepts of the good life. You respected your father and mother, along with a large number of others including teachers, elderly people, government officials, and policemen. You were not greedy, envious, or impatient, although you might feel all of these with some regularity. You never cast the first stone nor did you notice the mote in your neighbor&#x2019;s eye when you so clearly had a plank in your own. And of course you forgave your enemies. Mma Ramotswe had tried to live according to these rules, and had, for the most part, succeeded. But if asked whether there was anybody who might be unfriendly towards her, she had to admit that yes, there was somebody to whom that description might be applied, although she had not asked for her enmity and had never sought to perpetuate it. This person, Violet Sephotho, was regrettably an opponent, but only because she&#x2014;not Mma Ramotswe&#x2014;had decided to adopt that position, and were peace to be offered Mma Ramotswe would willingly accede. And there was another thing: although this person was hostile to Mma Ramotswe, her real target was Mma Makutsi, who had no compunction at all in declaring that between her and Violet Sephotho there existed a state of hostility that was to all intents and purposes undeclared war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Violet Sephotho had been at the Botswana Secretarial College at the same time as Mma Makutsi. Their respective attitudes towards the college could not have been more different: for Mma Makutsi the college represented the Parnassus to which she had long aspired&#x2014;the institution that would deliver her from her life of poverty and struggle and equip her for a career in an office. For that she was pro�foundly and unconditionally grateful. She was completely committed to her studies the day they began; she never missed a lecture, and always occupied a seat in the front row; she completed every exercise and assignment on time and absorbed every piece of advice given by her tutors. At lectures she listened in respectful silence, writing everything down in the blue- bound notebooks that cost more than she could really afford&#x2014;the purchase of a new notebook meant no lunch for a week; buying a textbook meant the forgoing of transport for at least a month. And when she graduated, on that unforgettable day, amidst the ululations of the proud aunts, she swore to herself that she would never forget the debt of gratitude she owed to the col�lege and its staff.<br>&nbsp;<br>Violet Sephotho felt none of this loyalty. She had taken up her place at the college because nothing else had turned up. Her exami�nation results at school were indifferent, and had she applied to the University of...</p></p><h2>Riveted (Iron Seas)</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Iron Duke</i> and <i>Heart of Steel</i> returns to the Iron Seas with a riveting new adventure of steampunk and passionate romance...</b> <p></p>A century after a devastating volcanic eruption forced Iceland's inhabitants to abandon its shores, the island became shrouded in secrecy.

And, if his luck held for the rest of the day, Harry was about to be employed to tell the story of the man he was going to visit. Indeed, he had been chosen to tell the whole story of this important man, this significant artist. How, he wondered, with a shudder, did you begin to do that? Where would you start, and how would the story, which was still being lived, end? More important, was he, Harry, capable of such a task?<br> <br>Peaceful England, untouched by war, revolution, famine, ethnic or religious disturbance. Yet, if the newspapers were correct, Britain was an overcrowded little island, teeming with busy immigrants, many clinging to the edges of the country, as on a small boat about to capsize. Not only that, thousands of asylum seekers and refugees, desperate to escape disturbance in the rest of the chaotic world, were attempting to cross the border. Some were packed in lorries, or hung from the undercarriages of trains; many were tiptoeing across the English Channel on tightropes slung across the sea, while others were fired from cannons based in Boulogne. Ghosts had it easy. Meanwhile, apparently, since the financial crash, everyone on board the country was so close together and claustrophobic they were beginning to turn on one another like trapped animals. With the coming scarcity&#x2014;few jobs, reduced pensions, and meager social security&#x2014;people&#x2019;s lives would deteriorate. The postwar safety Harry and his family had grown up in was gone. Yet, to Harry now, it seemed as if the government was deliberately injecting a strong shot of anxiety into the body politic, because all he could see was a green and pleasant England: healthy cattle, neat fields, trimmed trees, bubbling streams, and the shining, early spring sky above. It didn&#x2019;t even look as though you could get a curry for miles.<br> <br>There was a whoosh, and beer spattered his face. He turned his head. Rob Deveraux, sitting opposite Harry and cracking open another tin, was a respected and innovative publisher. He had approached Harry with the idea of commissioning him to write a biography of the distinguished writer, Indian-born Mamoon Azam, a novelist, essayist, and playwright Harry had admired since he was a teenage book fiend, a nerdy connoisseur of sentences, a kid for whom writers were gods, heroes, rock stars. Harry was immediately responsive and excited. After years of study and obedience, things were turning good for him, as his teachers had predicted if he concentrated his thoughts and zipped his fly and lip. This was his break; he could have wept with relief and excitement.<br> <br>He deserved it, he reckoned. A couple of years before, in his late twenties, Harry had published a well-received biography of Nehru containing much new material, and although the familiar story had now, in the modern manner, to be lightly spiced with interracial copulation, buggery, alcoholism, and anorexia, the work was considered, on the whole, to be illuminating. Even the Indians liked it. For Harry it had been &#x201c;homework.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was reviewing books and teaching now, while looking for a new project to invest his creative passion, energy, and commitment in; something, he hoped, that would make his name, launching him into the public world and a rosy future.<br> <br>Today, on a bright Sunday morning, Harry and Rob were on the train to Taunton to visit Mamoon at the house where the legendary writer had lived for most of his adult life, sharing it now with his second wife, Liana Luccioni, a spirited Italian woman in her early fifties. The world from the window&#x2014;his England&#x2014;would have kept Harry calm and easy, except that Rob, like a boxing coach, insisted on coaxing and goading his boy in preparation for the fight ahead.<br> <br>Rob was explaining that it was both an advantage and a nuisance writing about someone who was alive. The subject himself could help you, he said, as Harry dabbed beer from his face with his handkerchief. The past might take on new tones as the subject looked back&#x2014;and it was Harry&#x2019;s job to inspire Mamoon to look back. Rob had no doubt that Mamoon would help Harry, since Mamoon had finally recognized that the book was becoming essential. Liana was proving to be extravagant, if not more expensive and, indeed, explosive than any woman Mamoon had experienced before. Rob had said it was as if Gandhi had married Shirley Bassey and they&#x2019;d gone to live in Ambridge.<br> <br>Mamoon had been much respected by the literary world, as well as by the right-wing newspapers. He was, at last, a writer from the Indian subcontinent they could like, someone who thought domination, particularly by the educated, informed, and intelligent&#x2014;people, oddly, who resembled himself&#x2014;was preferable to universal stupidity, or even democracy.<br> <br>But, being too cerebral, unyielding and harrowing to be widely read, Mamoon was becoming financially undone; despite the praise and the prizes, he was in fiscal turnaround. Currently he was in the process of selling his archive to an American university. Before it also became necessary for him to remortgage his house, his wife and his agent had agreed that the best way to perk up his quiet career&#x2014;Mamoon had become the sort of writer of whom people asked &#x201c;Is he still alive, do you know?&#x201d;&#x2014;was for a &#x201c;controversial&#x201d; new biography to be published with, on the cover, the subject as an irresistibly handsome and dangerous young man. The sharp, memorable image would be as important as the words: think Kafka, Greene, Beckett, writers whose taciturnity never stood in the way of a hot, moody photo. This, then, was the book Harry would write. The biography would be an &#x201c;event,&#x201d; a &#x201c;big bang,&#x201d; accompanied, of course, by a television documentary, interviews, a reading tour, and the reissuing of Mamoon&#x2019;s books in forty languages.<br> <br>On the other hand, continued Rob, the fact that the author was alive could inhibit a biographer. Rob had met the man about a dozen times; and he said that Mamoon, to his credit, was more Norman Mailer than E. M. Forster. Inhibition, Rob reckoned, was something Harry needed none of here. It wouldn&#x2019;t suit the subject.<br> <br>On his side, Harry considered Rob to be more of a Norman Mailer than Mamoon, who had seemed restrained and dignified on the one occasion Harry had met him. Rob was a disheveled unshaven brilliant maverick, who usually smelled of alcohol. Today he had turned up actually drunk and began drinking beer the moment they got on the train&#x2014;while eating crisps continuously, bits of which adhered to his face and clothes like flakes of dandruff. Rob considered writing a form of extreme combat, and humanity&#x2019;s &#x201c;saving grace.&#x201d; For him, the writer should be the very devil, a disturber of dreams and wrecker of fatuous utopias, the bringer-in of reality, and rival of God in his wish to make worlds.<br> <br>Now Harry nodded gravely across the table at Rob, as he always did; he didn&#x2019;t want to betray any alarm.<br> <br>If Harry thought of himself as a cautious if not conservative person, Rob appeared to encourage his authors toward pugnacity, dissipation, and &#x201c;authenticity&#x201d; for fear, some thought, that the act and art of writing, or even editing, might appear &#x201c;artistic,&#x201d; feminine, nancy, or, possibly, &#x201c;gay.&#x201d; Never mind Mamoon, Harry had heard numerous tales of Rob&#x2019;s &#x201c;sociopathic&#x201d; tendencies. He didn&#x2019;t go into the office until five in the afternoon, though he would stay there all night, editing, phoning, and working, perhaps popping into Soho. He had married, not long ago, but appeared to have forgotten that wedlock was a continuous state rather than a one-off event. He slept in different places, often in some discomfort and with a book over his face, while appearing to inhabit a time zone that collapsed and expanded according to need rather than the clock, which he considered to be fascist. If he became bored by someone, he would turn away, or even slap them. He would cut his writers&#x2019; work arbitrarily, or change the title, without informing them.<br> <br>Not that Harry had minded about the tales of madness, being aware that it is only the insane who achieve anything significant. Besides, Rob&#x2019;s publishing outfit had won numerous big prizes, and Rob was powerful, persuasive, and potent. Having lunched and chatted with him at parties for five years, Harry couldn&#x2019;t say, until today, that he&#x2019;d witnessed much debauchery himself. Rob had the hippest list in London, and was as much an artist as an innovative movie or record producer. He made things happen and took risks; he was said to be &#x201c;lateral.&#x201d; Harry had never dreamt that Rob would invite him to work with him. Not only that, Rob would pay Harry a substantial advance for this book. If Harry borrowed money from his father, he should be able to afford the deposit on a small house he wanted to buy with Alice, his fianc�e, whom he&#x2019;d been seeing for three years, and who had moved into his bachelor flat. They had talked about having children, though Harry thought they should be more settled before committing to this.<br> <br>It had occurred to Harry, in the last year, at least, as he matured, that he needed to be well off. It wasn&#x2019;t his first priority, which was to be serious, but he was beginning to see that his list of life achievements might have to include a hefty amount of money in the bank, a token of his status, ability, and privilege. Rob had volunteered to help with this, aiding Harry on his journey. It was about time. &#x201c;I am your Mephistopheles, and I pronounce you now officially rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll,&#x201d; Rob had said. &#x201c;The day will come, of course, when you will have to thank me for this. And thank me hard. Perhaps you might gratefully kiss me on the lips, or give me your tongue.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the train drew them closer to the meeting, Rob&#x2019;s instruction was that Harry should write &#x201c;as mad and wild&#x201d; a book as he could. This would be Harry&#x2019;s breakthrough. He should practice his autograph; he would be feted at literary festivals in South America, India, and Italy, appear on television, and give well-paid talks and lectures on the nature of truth and the biographer&#x2019;s servitude to it. It would be his ticket to ride. If you wrote one successful book, you could live in its light for ten years.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not get carried away. It&#x2019;ll be a fire-walk.&#x201d; Rob gulped at his beer. &#x201c;The old man will exasperate you with his stubbornness and taunting. As for his wife, you know she can be sweet and amusing. But you might have to sleep with her, otherwise she could smoke you down like a cigarette.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In Rome, where she lived, and where she grabbed Mamoon, she was known as a man-eater who never passed on a meal. And you are a hog with a keen snout, when it comes to sniffing out the truffle of a woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rob, please&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The editor went on, &#x201c;Listen up: that clever old sly fox Mamoon might seem dull and dead to you, and indeed to everyone, including his own family.&#x201d; He leaned forward and whispered, &#x201c;He comes on like someone who has never knowingly given pleasure to a woman, someone who has never loved anyone more than himself. He has stolen a lot of enjoyment. He has been a dirty bastard, an adulterer, liar, thug, and, possibly, a murderer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How common is this knowledge?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will make it known. Extreme biography: that is your job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Marion, his ex-mistress, a Baconian torso on a plank, is bitter as cancer and spitting gobbets of hate to this day. She lives in America and not only will she see you, she&#x2019;ll fly at you like a radioactive bat. I&#x2019;ve organized your visit&#x2014;some people accuse me of being a perfectionist. There is also the fact he drove his first wife, Peggy, over the edge. I&#x2019;m sure he wrapped oranges in a towel and beat her blacker and bluer than a decayed Stilton.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He did?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Investigate. I&#x2019;ve insisted you have access to her diaries.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He agreed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Harry, the Great Literary Satan is weak and woozy now like a lion hit with a monster tranquilizer. It&#x2019;s his time to be taken. And it&#x2019;s in his interest to cooperate. When he reads the book and learns what a bastard he&#x2019;s been, it&#x2019;ll be too late. You will have found out stuff that Mamoon doesn&#x2019;t even know about himself. He&#x2019;ll be dead meat on the skewer of your insight. That&#x2019;s where the public like their artists&#x2014;exposed, trousers down, arse up, doing a long stretch among serial killers, and shitting in front of strangers. That&#x2019;ll teach &#x2019;em to think their talent makes them better than mediocre no-brain tax-paying wage slaves like us.&#x201d;<br> <br>According to Rob, the publishers would sell the &#x201c;juicy&#x201d; parts of the book to the Sunday newspapers; it would be reviewed internationally, and there could be excellent sales in numerous languages. And again, when Mamoon died&#x2014;&#x201c;I hope,&#x201d; said Rob, not someone to miss an opportunity, &#x201c;in about five years&#x2019; time&#x201d;&#x2014;the book would sell once more, with a new chapter ripping through the author&#x2019;s final flirtations, last illness, death, obituaries, and the unacknowledged children and, of course, mistresses who would flock to the funeral, and then to the newspapers, thrashing at their breasts, pulling out their hair, and preparing their memoirs as they fought amongst themselves.<br> <br>The train rolled through graveyard towns, and Harry found his body rioting at the thought of meeting Mamoon today; indeed, he felt afraid of the whole project, particularly since, as Rob drank more, he kept repeating that this would be Harry&#x2019;s &#x201c;break.&#x201d; Rob &#x201c;believed&#x201d; in Harry but had gone on to insist Harry was far from fulfilling his potential, a potential which he, Rob, had recognized against considerable opposition. With Rob a kiss was usually followed by a clout.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have been priming Mamoon for you, man,&#x201d; Rob added, as the train approached the station.<br> <br>&#x201c;Priming him how?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been told you know your stuff, and stay up for nights reading the densest material, Hegel, Derrida, Musil, Milton&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve said I understand Hegel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not an easy sell. I was starting from zero with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Suppose he asks me about Hegel&#x2019;s dialectic?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to give him an overview.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about my first book? You must have sent it to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had to, finally. But it had its longueurs, even your mother would agree. The old man struggled to get through the introduction and had to lie down for a week with Suetonius to clean his palate. So reach the new level, man, or you&#x2019;ll be so fucked you&#x2019;ll have to get work as an academic. Or even worse&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Worse? What could be worse than a former polytechnic?&#x201d; Rob paused and glanced out of the window before delivering the news. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d have to teach creative writing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, no. I&#x2019;m not qualified.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even better.

In South and Southeast Asia and the Himalayas, the lamp, as a bearer of light, came to be perceived as a vehicle through which the divine could be accessed. The design, construction, and use of the lamp in these regions have been synonymous with the faith of the devotee since ancient times. Today the lamp continues to play a pivotal role in Hindu and Buddhist religious contexts, allowing the faithful to concentrate on the image or nature of the deity.<br><br>The 76 remarkable metal lamps and incense burners illustrated in <i>Flames of Devotion</i> form the heart of a collection assembled by the preeminent scholar of Indian and Himalayan art Pratapaditya Pal and his wife, Chitralekha. They are noteworthy for their ingenious design and diverse crafting, as well as their iconographic richness. They represent fourteen states in India, a majority coming from Rajasthan and Gujarat in the west, the tribal areas in central Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In addition, stunning examples of lamps from Nepal and Tibet showcase the skill with which precious metals were employed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and a small selection of early incense burners and lamps from Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam show the role these objects played in the ancient imagination.<br><br>In an engaging and highly informative text, architect and art historian Sean Anderson investigates why lamps have endured and remain omnipresent in Hindu and Buddhist practice. While examining the historical importance of the lamp, Anderson emphasizes that as altar and tool, icon and fine sculpture, it is an evocative reminder of an undying devotion forged with the most common yet enigmatic of materials: metal and fire. He considers as well the liminal space the lamp occupies between the secular and the sacred in societies where it is often used to mark every event of significance from birth to death.</p><p><p>Bronze oil lamps from South and Southeast Asia and the Himalayas</p>ART</p><h2>Sea of Dangers: Captain Cook and His Rivals in the South Pacific</h2><p>In 1769 two ships set out independently in search of a missing continent: a French merchant ship, the <i>St. Jean-Baptiste</i>, commanded by Jean de Surville, and a small British naval vessel, the <i>Endeavour</i>, commanded by Captain James Cook. That Christmas, in New Zealand waters, the two captains were almost within sight of each other, though neither knew of the other's existence. This is the stirring tale of these rival ships and the men who sailed in them. Cook's first long voyage was one of the most remarkable in recorded history. He not only sailed around the world, following the most difficult route any navigator had ever attempted; he also changed the maps of the world. In heavy seas he made a more thorough search for the missing continent-believed to lie somewhere between New Zealand and South America-than had ever been made. He was the first to explore most of the New Zealand coast and a vast stretch of the east coast of Australia, and the first to explore the longest reef in the world, the Great Barrier Reef. In Jakarta and Cape Town, and in the seas between them, Cook lost a third of his crew to tropical illnesses, after earlier saving them from scurvy. The ship in which he circled the world was not much larger in area than a tennis court. Along with the de Surville vessel, the sea was an arena of international rivalry, for during his voyage Cook encountered Dutch, Spanish, French, and Portuguese competitors and suspicions. Geoffrey Blainey brings his marvelous storytelling powers to bear on this fascinating and important adventure, drawing us brilliantly into the lives of the major figures.</p><p>Geoffrey Blainey, one of Australia's most important historians, has also written <i>A Short History of the World</i>, <i>A Short History of the 20th Century</i>, and <i>Black Kettle and Full Moon</i>. He holds Australia's highest honor, Companion in the Order of Australia. He lives in Melbourne.Renowned Australian historian Blainey (<i>A Short History of the World</i>) homes in on a detailed account of the 1768&#x2013;1771 exploratory voyage of English navigator Capt. James Cook and the contemporaneous voyage of the rival French captain Jean de Surville through the same previously uncharted waters. Each hoped to find David Land, a continent thought to lie in waters between New Zealand and South America rumored to have a Jewish colony and be rich in gold and natural resources. Blainey, a good storyteller, focuses primarily on Cook, recreating a compelling, sometimes minute-to-minute account of the historic voyage. The recounting of the near loss of the aptly named <i>Endeavour</i> on Australia's Great Barrier Reef is gripping. His descriptions of the conditions the sailors faced (tropical diseases and scurvy take a tremendous toll) are harrowing in their exactitude&#x2014;and his accounts of how Cook and de Surville viewed the native populations they met presage how fatally dangerous Europeans were to be to indigenous peoples. Blainey's knowledge of his material and his respect for the skills of Cook and de Surville make this an attractive tale for history enthusiasts.

How do we live a meaningful life in an age of global uncertainty and instability? In To Heal a Fractured World, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks offers answers to these questions by looking at the ethics of responsibility. In his signature plainspoken, accessible style, Rabbi Sacks shares with us traditional interpretations of the Bible, Jewish law, and theology, as well as the works of philosophers and ethicists from other cultures, to examine what constitutes morality and moral behavior. &#x201c;We are here to make a difference,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;a day at a time, an act at a time, for as long as it takes to make the world a place of justice and compassion.&#x201d; He argues that in today&#x2019;s religious and political climate, it is more important than ever to return to the essential understanding that &#x201c;it is by our deeds that we express our faith and make it real in the lives of others and the world.&#x201d;<br><br>To Heal a Fractured World&#x2014;inspirational and instructive, timely and timeless&#x2014;will resonate with people of all faiths.</p><p>Jonathan Sacks has been Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of Great Britain and the Commonwealth since 1991 and has received honorary degrees from universities around the world. He is the award-winning author of a dozen previous books, writes frequently for The Times (London) and other periodicals, and is heard regularly on the BBC. Rabbi Sacks was knighted in 2005. He lives in London.Chapter 1<br>The Ethics of Responsibility<br> One of Judaism's most distinctive and challenging ideas is its ethics of responsibility, the idea that God invites us to become, in the rabbinic phrase, his 'partners in the work of creation'. The God who created the world in love calls on us to create in love. The God who gave us the gift of freedom asks us to use it to honour and enhance the freedom of others. God, the ultimate Other, asks us to reach out to the human other. More than God is a strategic intervener, he is a teacher. More than he does our will, he teaches us how to do his. Life is God's call to responsibility. That is the theme of this book.<br><br> More than any previous generation in history, we have come to see the individual as the sole source of meaning. The gossamer filaments of connection between us and others, that once held together families, communities and societies, have become attenuated. We have become lonely selves in search of purely personal fulfilment. But that surely must be wrong. Life alone is only half a life. One spent pursuing the satisfaction of desire is less than satisfying and never all we desire. So it is worth reminding ourselves that there is such a thing as ethics, and it belongs to the life we live together and the goods we share - the goods that only exist in virtue of being shared.<br><br> That is one of Judaism's enduring insights. To give an example: in 1190 Moses Maimonides, the greatest rabbi of the Middle Ages, published The Guide for the Perplexed, the most challenging work of Jewish philosophy ever written. In it he addresses the most exalted themes of religious thought - the existence of God, the limits of human knowledge, the problem of evil and the reasons for the commands. It is a formidably difficult work. Yet in its closing chapter he summarizes his teachings with a quote from Jeremiah:<br> This is what the Lord says:<br><br> 'Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom<br><br> or the strong man boast of his strength<br><br> or the rich man boast of his riches,<br><br> but let him who boasts boast about this:<br><br> that he understands and knows Me,<br><br> that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness,<br><br> justice and righteousness on earth,<br><br> for in these I delight',<br><br> declares the Lord. (Jer. 9:23-4)<br> I find it moving that at the end of his journey through intellectual space, Maimonides is drawn back to this simple affirmation of kindness, righteousness and justice. We cannot know God, Maimonides implies ('If I could understand him', one Jewish writer said, 'I would be him'), but we can act like him. Within the limits of human intelligence, we can climb at least part of the way to heaven, but the purpose of the climb is the return to earth, knowing that here is where God wants us to be and where he has given us work to do. Judaism contains mysteries, but its ultimate purpose is not mysterious at all. It is to honour the image of God in other people, and thus turn the world into a home for the divine presence.<br><br> Maimonides lived what he taught. More than most, he valued solitude and meditation. He writes of it eloquently. Only when removed from the stresses and cares of the world, he says, can the soul soar in intellectual union with the Author of being. Yet he lived the latter years of his life as a physician (he was doctor to the Sultan in Cairo and had an extensive practice in his town, Fostat) and as a communal leader, consulted by<br><br> Jews and non-Jews alike. The acknowledged head of Egyptian Jewry, he answered questions sent to him by communities throughout the world. When the Provencal scholar Samuel ibn Tibbon wanted to visit him to seek guidance on the translation of the Guide from Arabic to Hebrew, Maimonides wrote him back a letter describing his typical week, in which he rarely had time to take a meal, let alone discuss technicalities of translation. It is a moving glimpse of the life of the great philosopher, spending his time healing the sick, guiding the members of his community, studying and praying with them, concerned no less with their bodies than with their souls.<br><br> When the disciples of the greatest Talmudist of the late nineteenth century, R. Hayyim of Brisk (1853-1918), asked him to define the task of a rabbi, he replied: 'To redress the grievances of those who are abandoned and alone, to protect the dignity of the poor, and to save the oppressed from the hands of his oppressor'. Constantly in debt, he gave most of his salary to the poor. In the winter he would leave his wood store unlocked so that the poor of the town could take the fuel they needed, without the embarrassment of having to ask. When the lay-leaders of the town complained that this was costing them money, he replied that he was saving them medical expenses, since otherwise he would be forced to sit in the cold and catch pneumonia. It was impossible, he said, for him to light a fire in his own home if he knew that, in other homes, the poor were freezing.<br><br> Judaism is a complex and subtle faith, yet it has rarely lost touch with its simple ethical imperatives. We are here to make a difference, to mend the fractures of the world, a day at a time, an act at a time, for as long as it takes to make it a place of justice and compassion where the lonely are not alone, the poor not without help; where the cry of the vulnerable is heeded and those who are wronged are heard. 'Someone else's physical needs are my spiritual obligation', a Jewish mystic taught. The truths of religion are exalted, but its duties are close at hand. We know God less by contemplation than by emulation. The choice is not between 'faith' and 'deeds', for it is by our deeds that we express our faith and make it real in the life of others and the world.<br><br> Jewish ethics is refreshingly down-to-earth. If someone is in need, give. If someone is lonely, invite them home. If someone you know has recently been bereaved, visit them and give them comfort. If you know of someone who has lost their job, do all you can to help them find another. The sages called this 'imitating God'. They went further: giving hospitality to a stranger, they said, is 'even greater than receiving the divine presence'. That is religion at its most humanizing and humane.<br><br> So too is its insistence that the ethical life is a form of celebration. Doing good is not painful, a matter of dour duty and a chastising conscience. There is a Hebrew word, a key term of the Bible, for which there is no precise English translation: simhah, usually translated as 'joy'. What it really means is the happiness we share, or better still, the happiness we make by sharing. One of the great statements of individual dignity and responsibility, Judaism is also an intensely communal faith, not simply a matter of the lonely soul in search of God, Plotinus' 'the flight of the alone to the Alone'. It is about sharing what we have, seeing possessions less as things we own than things we hold in trust, one of the conditions of which is that we use part of what we have to help others. That is not<br><br> self-sacrifice. If there is one thing I have heard more often than any other from those who spend part of their time in service to others, it is that they gain more than they give. They do not want to be thanked; they want to thank. Lifting others, they find that they themselves have been lifted.<br><br> The ethic of responsibility is the best answer I know to the meaning and meaningfulness of a life. When I first became a rabbi, the most difficult duty I had to perform was a funeral service. New to the position and the people, I often hardly knew the deceased, while to everyone else present he or she had been a member of the family, or an old and close friend. There was nothing to do but to get help from others. I would ask them what the person who had died meant to them. It did not take long before I recognized a pattern in their replies.<br><br> Usually they would say that the deceased had been a supportive husband or wife, a loving parent, a loyal friend. They spoke about the good they had done to others, often quietly, discreetly, without ostentation. When you needed them, they were there. They shouldered their responsibilities to the community. They gave to charitable causes, and if they could not give money, they gave time. Those most mourned and missed were not the most successful, rich or famous. They were the people who enhanced the lives of others. These were the people who were loved.<br><br> This reinforced for me the crucial distinction between the urgent and the important. No one ever spoke, in praise of someone who had died, about the car they drove, the house they owned, the clothes they wore, the exotic holidays they took. No one's last thought was ever, 'I wish I had spent more time in the office'. The things we spend most of our time pursuing turn out to be curiously irrelevant when it comes to seeing the value of a life as a whole. They are urgent but not important, and in the crush and press of daily life, the urgent tends to win out over the important.<br><br> Happiness, as opposed to pleasure, is a matter of a life well lived, one that honours the important, not just the urgent. This has been confirmed by many recent research studies. One showed that life satisfaction increased 24 per cent with the level of altruistic activity. Another discovered that those who had more opportunities to help others felt 11 per cent better about themselves. Several studies have shown that the best predictor of happiness is the sense that you have a purpose in life. Those who hold strong spiritual beliefs are typically satisfied with life, while those who have no spiritual beliefs are typically unsatisfied. People who feel responsible for their lives express one-t...</p><h2>A Taste of Mey: Recipes and Memories Inspired by the Castle of Mey</h2><p>Recipes inspired by the Castle of Mey Caithness home of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

Unlike the first two volumes (<i>The Raw and the Cooked, From Honey to Ashes</i>), which are devoted to South American myths, the present one establishes relations with North America, which is the subject of the fourth (<i>The Naked Man</i>). . . . In the course of the analysis, the myths link up with ideas of more general interest. Thus, we find discussions of numeration, of morals, and of the origin of the novel. . . . <i>The Origin of Table Manners</i> is thus of special interest to students of American Indian mythology, although it contains ideas of interest to other fields and even to the general reader."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;Daniel C.

Renowned experts Marylin M. Rhie and Robert A. F.

Yet, as this breathtakingly beautiful volume shows, it is a manifestation of Buddha's highest spiritual essence, symbolizing the union of wisdom and compassion. This catalogue of a traveling exhibition features 160 Tibetan sacred paintings, sculptures, tapestries and other works.

It was the first time the champion had hailed from outside the Continent or the States and the first time in 20 years a British team&#x2014;ANC Halfords&#x2014;had competed in the world's toughest and craziest race. Jeff Connor, on assignment there as a newspaper reporter, not only stayed with the British team but also found himself an unofficial team member, driving, sorting out hotel rooms, packing, and unpacking. In this long-awaited new edition of <i>Wide-Eyed and Legless</i>, now widely regarded as a classic of cycling literature, Connor describes in detail what it takes to compete, survive, and win during those 26 days of grueling effort in the name of sport. Alongside the heroism and athleticism, he reveals the extraordinary amounts of chicanery, from pulling riders along to illicit drug use. Time has not dimmed the impact of this eye-opening and entertaining close-up look at the supreme endurance event that is the Tour de France, and <i>Wide-Eyed and Legless</i> is destined to be acclaimed by a whole new generation of cycling enthusiasts.</p><p><b>Jeff Connor</b> was born in Manchester and now lives in Edinburgh.

But his command is fragile. He rules an empire with a technology beyond human understanding; spies lurk in the ancient Magisterium; the Tarig overlords are hamstrung but still malevolent. Worse, his daughter Sen Ni opposes him for control, believing the Earth and its Rose universe must die to sustain the failing Entire. She is aided by one of the mystical pilots of the River Nigh, the space-time transport system. This navitar, alone among all others, can alter future events. He retires into a crystal chamber in the Nigh to weave reality and pit his enemies against each other. <br><br>Taking advantage of these chaotic times, the great foe of the Long War, the Jinda ceb Horat, create a settlement in the Entire. Masters of supreme technology, they maintain a lofty distance from the Entire&#x2019;s struggle. They agree, however, that the Tarig must return to the fiery Heart of their origins. With the banishment immanent, some Tarig lords rebel, fleeing to hound the edges of Quinn&#x2019;s reign. <br><br>Meanwhile, Quinn&#x2019;s wife Anzi becomes a hostage and penitent among the Jinda ceb, undergoing alterations that expose their secrets, but may estrange her from her husband. As Quinn moves toward a confrontation with the dark navitar, he learns that the stakes of the conflict go far beyond the Rose versus the Entire--extending to a breathtaking dominance. The navitar commands forces that lie at the heart of the Entire&#x2019;s geo-cosmology, and will use them to alter the calculus of power. As the navitar&#x2019;s plan approaches consummation, Quinn, Sen Ni, and Anzi are swept up in forces that will leave them forever changed. <br><br>In this rousing finale to Kenyon&#x2019;s celebrated quartet, Titus Quinn meets an inevitable destiny, forced at last to make the unthinkable choice for or against the dictates of his heart, for or against the beloved land.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Kay Kenyon sold her first science fiction novel, <i>The Seeds of Time, </i>to Bantam in 1997.

His daughter, Sen Ni, opposes him, believing the Rose is not worth saving, and the Entire ought to steal its energy. She remains allied with mad Geng De, a navitar, or pilot of space-time transport, who calls her sister as he weaves the flows of the future. The Jinda ceb Horat, enemies of the Tarig overlords, return to their minoral and resolutely maintain neutrality, even after Titus&#x2019; wife, Anzi, goes to them to petition a teacher of their ways. Fortunately, some of the Jinda ceb Horat like to shake things up: the elder Venn, for instance, who&#x2019;s a little strange but fascinating. Titus continues fighting Geng De. The engine at Ahenhoon has been destroyed, and earth is safe, but the fate of the Entire takes more to resolve. Leaving just enough to the reader&#x2019;s imagination, Kenyon ties up loose ends with a fair bit of action and some fascinating developments in the workings of the Entire and the Rose tetralogy&#x2019;s world. --Regina Schroeder</p><h2>Early Greece: The Bronze and Archaic Ages (Ancient Culture and Society)</h2><p><p><strong>This admirable study has now been revised and enlarged by Professor Finley in the light of the latest archeological evidence and relevant scholarship. It provides, succinctly and authoritatively, the background information needed for a proper understanding of classical Greek civilization</strong></p> M. I.

He discusses the problems that dependence on such evidence poses for the historian, for, although archeology reveals changes and even cataclysms, it rarely allows us more than a restricted view of a society under normal conditions.

A leading figure within the Nazi Party, he was responsible more than Himmler for the planning and execution of the Holocaust. Having joined the Nazi Party in 1931, Heydrich rose quickly through the ranks of the SS. By the age of twenty-nine he had become an SS Brigadier General, and his ruthless ambition led many senior Nazis to believe that he was the natural successor to Hitler. It was Heydrich&#x2019;s initiative to create the Einsatzgruppen, paramilitary units which were established before Operation Barbarossa to murder Jews and political operatives of the Communist party. In 1941 Heydrich was made Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. Supremely confident of his authority within the province, he would often drive alone in an open-top car. British-trained Czech partisans took advantage of this gesture, and in 1942 carried out a daring assassination attempt. Heydrich was mortally wounded in the ambush and died a week later in hospital. The reprisals that followed were brutal: more than 15,000 Czechs were murdered and the town of Lidice was razed to the ground. This book examines Heydrich&#x2019;s meteoric rise to power, his complex personality, and the aftermath of his death: Hitler&#x2019;s vengeance and the postwar fortunes of Heydrich&#x2019;s widow and descendants.</p><p>Mario Dederichs was Washington, Moscow and Bonn correspondent for <i>Stern</i> magazine.<p><b><i>WWII History,</i> May 2007<br> </b>&#x201c;There have been several comprehensive biographies of Heydrich, but Mario Dederich&#x2019;s fine depiction burnishes new faces of the life and times of the man some have called &#x2018;The Blond Beast.&#x2019; Dederichs, who passed away shortly after completing this manuscript, had access to Heydrich&#x2019;s widow&#x2019;s memoirs and was able to obtain rare interviews with his son and daughter, thus creating a more complete and personal portrait than ever before.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;For those who wish to learn more about the workings of Hitler&#x2019;s inner circle, and the types of individuals who held the reins of power in the Third Reich, Dederich&#x2019;s book provides a chilling glimpse into this frightening world.&#x201d;</p><br><br>"With journalistic flair and historical awareness Mario R Dederichs pursues the trail of this copybook-Nazi. He spares readers nothing. He takes them to Auschwitz, and to the edge of the execution trench, standing naked, awaiting a bullet from those less couth than the planners of these murders. Archives from Berlin to Jerusalem lay on Dederichs' path, and everywhere he found previously overlooked witnesses, for example the only Czech doctor to assist at the unsuccessful emergency surgery on Heydrich. By the time he finishes the book, the reader has realized that the face of evil is not to be found only below the bald pate of the stupid skinhead. It is the fanatics with a good civil service background who need watching."<br> -- Goslarsche Zeitung<br><br> "Journalist Mario R Dederichs has succeeded in writing a gripping short biography which is very acceptable in content and style. He demonstrates skilfully the many facets of the 'man with the icy stare'."<br> -- Ulrike Steinbach<br><br><p>"Dederichs has condensed sketches from Fest, studies by Aronson, Deschner, Calic and Sydnor on one side of the narrative, and enlarged upon them with his own archive research and interviews with eye-witnesses. Many new details and nuances in no way reject the existing picture, however. The text is particularly impressive where the author focusses on the treatment of National Socialist crimes by German justice after 1945, especially the later struggle of Heydrich's widow for her pension rights. Additionally the depiction of Heydrich's web of informers and Fuehrer-elite is fascinating. The readability, scope, adherence to fact, psychological evaluation and a thorough method bolster the author's intention to explain the most oppressive epoch of German and European history to a new generation."<br> -- Professor Manfred Funke, Lecturer in Political Science, Bonn University.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The central question of the biography is how this man came to be an embodiment of evil. Dederichs approaches the person of Reinhard Heydrich through meticulous research and eye-witness interviews. His journalist's pen has made the life of the Gestapo-chief into a gripping story. At the same time, the text withstands scientific scrutiny thanks to its detailed evaluation of sources."-- Main Echo</p></p><h2>Garden Way&#39;s Guide to Food Drying: How to Dehydrate, Store and Use Vegtables, Fruits and Herbs</h2><p>Guidelines for drying foods for hiking and camping are presented together with dried soup mixes, discussion on drying equipment, and instructions for dehydrating, storing, and using vegetables, fruits, and herbs</p><p></p><h2>Noah&#39;s Ark</h2><p>Retells in pictures how a pair of every manner of creature climbed on board Noah&#39;s ark and thereby survived the Flood.</p><p>The bee and the fox, the sheep and the ox--two of each kind trudged aboard Noah's famous vessel.

Written by one of the foremost experts in frontier military history and reviewed by members of the Nez Perce tribe, this definitive treatment of the Nez Perce War is the first to incorporate research from all known accounts of Nez Perce and U.S. military participants.Enhanced by sixteen detailed maps and forty-nine historic photographs, Jerome A. Greene's gripping narrative takes readers on a three-and-a-half-month, 1,700-mile journey across the wilds of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana territories. All of the skirmishes and battles of the war receive detailed treatment, which benefits from Greene's astute analysis of both sides' strategies and decision making. Between 100 and 150 of the more than 800 Nez Perce men, women, and children who began the trek were killed during the war. Almost as many died in the months following the surrender, after they were exiled to malaria-ridden northwestern Oklahoma. Army deaths numbered 113. The casualties, on both sides, were an extraordinary price for a war that nobody wanted, but whose history has since intrigued generations of Americans.

First a toy train disappears. Then Prinny the Dog's dinner is missing and Egbert the Rabbit is nowhere to be found. The animals of Bean Farm need a detective, and fast! Luckily, Freddy the Pig is on the case. Having just finished reading Sherlock Holmes, Freddy and his partner Mrs. Wiggins the Cow set up a detective agency in the barn. But when Freddy's best friend Jinx the Cat is framed for a dastardly deed, all of Freddy's detecting skills are put to the test.</p><p>"Oh, I am the King of Detectives, / And when I am out on the trail / All the animal criminals tremble, / And the criminal animals quail..." boasts Freddy, the poetry-prone, Sherlock Holmes-obsessed pig who stars in Walter R. Brooks's beloved series. From 1927 to 1958, Brooks wrote 26 Freddy books--including <i>Freddy Goes to Florida</i>--all focused on the well-rounded pig, who has been described by various fans as ingenious, intelligent, loyal, and resourceful. Since Brooks's books fell out of print, librarians across the country have scrounged up copies wherever possible, even resorting to photocopying the books and binding them with hockey-stick tape! To the delight of thousands, the fabulous Freddy books have been reprinted by Overlook Press!<p> The intrigue of <i>Freddy the Detective</i> begins on the Bean Farm (Freddy's upstate New York abode), when a toy train is discovered missing from young Everett Bean's room. Freddy jumps at the chance to prove his sleuth skills: "I'll find that train, you bet! There are a lot of mysteries on a farm like this and I'll solve 'em all!" he proclaims. The pig can't gracefully outfox the rats (and they sing derisive songs about him), but eventually he does solve cases from "The Mystery of Egbert" (about a bunny who'd wandered off from his family) to "The Case of Prinny's Dinner" (about a white woolly dog's missing food). The shenanigans all sound innocent enough, but Brooks is hilariously tongue-in-cheek; his insightful descriptions of animal characters are always compassionate; and his subtle appeal to a child's instinct for justice is no less than masterful. As Adam Hochschild of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> writes, "The moral center of my childhood universe, the place where good and evil, friendship and treachery, honesty and humbug were defined most clearly, was not church, not school, and not the Boy Scouts. It was the Bean Farm." Welcome back, Freddy! (Ages 9 to 12, but great for reading aloud to younger children.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Walter R.

Jeffers (The Good Cigar) bolsters his thesis that pipe smoking has remained an especially American phenomenon for decades with a portrait gallery of famous pipe enthusiasts?from Benjamin Franklin and Davy Crockett to Emerson, Mark Twain, Alexander Graham Bell, Einstein, Robert Frost, Norman Rockwell, Edward Teller, Neil Armstrong and George Bush. Decked out with engravings, paintings, sketches and photographs, and enlivened by nostalgic songs, ballads, ditties and memorabilia, his survey ranges from ancient Celts' smoking of aromatic herbs in iron pipes to pipe-related organizations on the Internet. At one point, Jeffers asserts that cigarette smoking doesn't cause the high incidence of cancer and other diseases attributed to it by the "health police," as he calls antismoking activists. This renders somewhat suspect his familiar argument that pipes pose greatly reduced health risks in comparison with cigarettes. But his thorough look at how to smoke pipes, the design and making of pipes, , pipe care and gadgetry, reliable vendors and convention-defying pipe-smoking women will be edifying to anyone with a penchant for the occasional puff.

As such, this tribute book is divided into two parts, one being a history of the pipe, the other a guide and how-to of pipe smoking, covering how to select, use, and maintain a pipe and what types of tobacco and pipe accessories are available. While the how-to information is straightforward enough, there are some glaring errors in the historical section. Jeffers states that Pocahontas met and became "the darling of Queen Elizabeth I"?difficult, considering that her visit to England was in 1616 and Queen Elizabeth died in 1603. Also cited is the Parson's Cause, the case that started Patrick Henry's career. Jeffers suggests the date of this event was 1775 and that Henry was hired by one Reverend Maury. In fact, the date of the case was 1763 and Henry and Maury opposed each other. Buy if there's a demand.?Robert A.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br><br><br>"Watch your step, please. Please, watch your step. Thank you." Liz took a ticket from a sunburned man with palm trees on his shirt, then waited patiently for a woman with two bulging straw baskets to dig out another one.<br><br>"I hope you haven't lost it, Mabel. I told you to let me hold it."<br><br>"I haven't lost it," the woman said testily before she pulled out the little piece of blue cardboard.<br><br>"Thank you. Please take your seats." It was several more minutes before everyone was settled and she could take her own. "Welcome aboard the <em>Fantasy, </em>ladies and gentlemen."<br><br>With her mind on a half dozen other things, Liz began her opening monologue. She gave an absentminded nod to the man on the dock who cast off the ropes before she started the engine. Her voice was pleasant and easy as she took another look at her watch. They were already fifteen minutes behind schedule. She gave one last scan of the beach, skimming by lounge chairs, over bodies already stretched and oiled slick, like offerings to the sun. She couldn't hold the tour any longer.<br><br>The boat swayed a bit as she backed it from the dock and took an eastern course. Though her thoughts were scattered, she made the turn from the coast expertly. She could have navigated the boat with her eyes closed. The air that ruffled around her face was soft and already warming, though the hour was early. Harmless and powder-puff white, clouds dotted the horizon. The water, churned by the engine, was as blue as the guidebooks promised. Even after ten years, Liz took none of it for granted&#x2014;especially her livelihood. Part of that depended on an atmosphere that made muscles relax and problems disappear.<br><br>Behind her in the long, bullet-shaped craft were eighteen people seated on padded benches. They were already murmuring about the fish and formations they saw through the glass bottom. She doubted if any of them thought of the worries they'd left behind at home.<br><br>"We'll be passing Paraiso Reef North," Liz began in a low, flowing voice. "Diving depths range from thirty to fifty feet. Visibility is excellent, so you'll be able to see star and brain corals, sea fans and sponges, as well as schools of sergeant majors, groupers and parrot fish. The grouper isn't one of your prettier fish, but it's versatile. They're all born female and produce eggs before they change sex and become functioning males."<br><br>Liz set her course and kept the speed steady. She went on to describe the elegantly colored angelfish, the shy, silvery small-mouth grunts, and the intriguing and dangerous sea urchin. Her clients would find the information useful when she stopped for two hours of snorkeling at Palancar Reef.<br><br>She'd made the run before, too many times to count. It might have become routine, but it was never monotonous. She felt now, as she always did, the freedom of open water, blue sky and the hum of engine with her at the controls. The boat was hers, as were three others, and the little concrete block dive shop close to shore. She'd worked for all of it, sweating through months when the bills were steep and the cash flow slight. She'd made it. Ten years of struggle had been a small price to pay for having something of her own. Turning her back on her country leaving behind the familiar, had been a small price to pay for peace of mind.<br><br>The tiny rustic island of Cozumel in the Mexican Caribbean promoted peace of mind. It was her home now, the only one that mattered. She was accepted there, respected. No one on the island knew of the humiliation and pain she'd gone through before she'd fled to Mexico. Liz rarely thought of it, though she had a vivid reminder.<br><br>Faith. Just the thought of her daughter made her smile. Faith was small and bright and precious, and so far away. Just six weeks, Liz thought, and she'd be home from school for the summer.<br><br>Sending her to Houston to her grandparents had been for the best, Liz reminded herself whenever the ache of loneliness became acute. Faith's education was more important than a mother's needs. Liz had worked, gambled, struggled so that Faith could have everything she was entitled to, everything she would have had if her father...<br><br>Determined, Liz set her mind on other things. She'd promised herself a decade before that she would cut Faith's father from her mind, just as he had cut her from his life. It had been a mistake, one made in na�vet� and passion, one that had changed the course of her life forever. But she'd won something precious from it: Faith.<br><br>"Below, you see the wreck of a forty-passenger Convair airliner lying upside down." She slowed the boat so that her passengers could examine the wreck and the divers out for early explorations. Bubbles rose from air tanks like small silver disks. "The wreck's no tragedy," she continued. "It was sunk for a scene in a movie and provides divers with easy entertainment."<br><br>Her job was to do the same for her passengers, she reminded herself. It was simple enough when she had a mate on board. Alone, she had to captain the boat, keep up the light, informative banter, deal with snorkel equipment, serve lunch and count heads. It just hadn't been possible to wait any longer for Jerry.<br><br>She muttered to herself a bit as she increased speed. It wasn't so much that she minded the extra work, but she felt her paying customers were entitled to the best she could offer. She should have known better than to depend on him. She could have easily arranged for someone else to come along. As it was, she had two men on the dive boat and two more in the shop. Because her second dive boat was due to launch at noon, no one could be spared to mate the glass bottom on a day trip. And Jerry had come through before, she reminded herself. With him on board, the women passengers were so charmed that Liz didn't think they even noticed the watery world the boat passed over.<br><br>Who could blame them? she thought with a half smile. If she hadn't been immune to men in general, Jerry might have had her falling over her own feet. Most women had a difficult time resisting dark, cocky looks, a cleft chin and smoky gray eyes. Add to that a lean, muscular build and a glib tongue, and no female was safe.<br><br>But that hadn't been why Liz had agreed to rent him a room, or give him a part-time job. She'd needed the extra income, as well as the extra help, and she was shrewd enough to recognize an operator when she saw one. Previous experience had taught her that it made good business sense to have an operator on your side. She told herself he'd better have a good excuse for leaving her without a crew, then forgot him.<br><br>The ride, the sun, the breeze relaxed her. Liz continued to speak of the sea life below, twining facts she'd learned while studying marine biology in college with facts she'd learned firsthand in the waters of the Mexican Caribbean. Occasionally one of her passengers would ask a question or call out in excitement over something that skimmed beneath them. She answered, commented and instructed while keeping the flow light. Because three of her passengers were Mexican, she repeated all her information in Spanish. Because there were several children on board, she made certain the facts were fun.<br><br>If things had been different, she would have been a teacher. Liz had long since pushed that early dream from her mind, telling herself she was more suited to the business world. Her business world. She glanced over where the clouds floated lazily over the horizon. The sun danced white and sharp on the surface of blue water. Below, coral rose like castles or waved like fans. Yes, she'd chosen her world and had no regrets.<br><br>When a woman screamed behind her, Liz let off the throttle. Before she could turn, the scream was joined by another. Her first thought was that perhaps they'd seen one of the sharks that occasionally visited the reefs. Set to calm and soothe, Liz let the boat drift in the current. A woman was weeping in her husband's arms, another held her child's face protectively against her shoulder. The rest were staring down through the clear glass. Liz took off her sunglasses as she walked down the two steps into the cabin.<br><br>"Please try to stay calm. I promise you, there's nothing down there that can hurt you in here."<br><br>A man with a Nikon around his neck and an orange sun visor over a balding dome gave her a steady look.<br><br>"Miss, you'd better radio the police."<br><br>Liz looked down through the clear glass, through the crystal blue water. Her heart rose to her throat. She saw now why Jerry had stood her up. He was lying on the white sandy bottom with an anchor chain wrapped around his chest.<br><br>***<br><br>The moment the plane finished its taxi, Jonas gathered his garment bag and waited impatiently for the door to be opened. When it did, there was a whoosh of hot air and the drone of engines. With a quick nod to the flight attendant he strode down the steep metal stairs. He didn't have the time or the inclination to appreciate the palm trees, the bursts of flowers or the dreamy blue sky. He walked purposefully, eyes straight ahead and narrowed against the sun. In his dark suit and trim tie he could have been a businessman, one who'd come to Cozumel to work, not to play. Whatever grief, whatever anger he felt were carefully masked by a calm, unapproachable expression.<br><br>The terminal was small and noisy. Americans on vacation stood in groups laughing or wandered in confusion. Though he knew no Spanish, Jonas passed quickly through customs then into a small, hot alcove where men waited at podiums to rent cars and Jeeps. Fifteen minutes after landing, Jonas was backing a compact out of a parking space and heading toward town with a map stuck in the sun visor. The heat baked right through the windshield.<br><br>Twenty-four hours before, Jonas had been sitting in his large, elegantly furnished, air-conditioned office. He'd just won along, tough case that had taken all his skill and mountains of research. His client was a free man, acquitted of a felony charge that carried a minimum sentence of ten years. He'd accepted his fee, accepted the gratitude and avoided as much publicity as possible.<br><br>Jonas had been preparing to take his first vacation in eighteen months. He'd felt satisfied, vaguely tired and optimistic. Two weeks in Paris seemed like the perfect reward for so many months of ten-hour days. Paris, with its ageless sophistication and cool parks, its stunning museums and incomparable food was precisely what suited Jonas Sharpe.<br><br>When the call had come through from Mexico, it had taken him several moments to understand. When he'd answered that he did indeed have a brother Jeremiah, Jonas's predominant thought had been that Jerry had gotten himself into trouble again, and he was going to have to bail him out.<br><br>By the time he'd hung up the phone, Jonas couldn't think at all. Numb, he'd given his secretary instructions to cancel his Paris arrangements and to make new ones for a flight to Cozumel the next day. Then Jonas had picked up the phone to call his parents and tell them their son was dead.<br><br>He'd come to Mexico to identify the body and take his brother home to bury. With a fresh wave of grief, Jonas experienced a sense of inevitability. Jerry had always lived on the edge of disaster. This time he'd stepped over. Since childhood Jerry had courted trouble&#x2014;charmingly. He'd once joked that Jonas had taken to law so he could find the most efficient way to get his brother out of jams. Perhaps in a sense it had been true.<br><br>Jerry had been a dreamer. Jonas was a realist. Jerry had been unapologetically lazy, Jonas a workaholic. They were&#x2014;had been&#x2014;two sides of a coin. As Jonas drew up to the police station in San Miguel it was with the knowledge that part of himself had been erased.<br><br>The scene at port should have been painted. There were small fishing boats pulled up on the grass. Huge gray ships sat complacently at dock while tourists in flowered shirts or skimpy shorts strolled along the sea wall. Water lapped and scented the air.<br><br>Jonas got out of the car and walked to the police station to begin to wade through the morass of paperwork that accompanied a violent death.<br><br>Captain Moralas was a brisk, no-nonsense man who had been born on the island and was passionately dedicated to protecting it. He was approaching forty and awaiting the birth of his fifth child. He was proud of his position, his education and his family, though the order often varied. Basically, he was a quiet man who enjoyed classical music and a movie on Saturday nights.<br><br>Because San Miguel was a port, and ships brought sailors on leave, tourists on holiday, Moralas was no stranger to trouble or the darker side of human nature. He did, however, pride himself on the low percentage of violent crime on his island. The murder of the American bothered him in the way a pesky fly bothered a man sitting contentedly on his porch swing. A cop didn't have to work in a big city to recognize a professional hit. There was no room for organized crime on Cozumel.<br><br>But he was also a family man. He understood love, and he understood grief, just as he understood certain men were compelled to conceal both. In the cool, flat air of the morgue, he waited beside Jonas. The American stood a head taller, rigid and pale.<br><br>"This is your brother, Mr. Sharpe?" Though he didn't have to ask.<br><br>Jonas looked down at the other side of the coin. "Yes."<br><br>In silence, he backed away to give Jonas the time he needed.<br><br>It didn't seem possible. Jonas knew he could have stood for hours staring down at his brother's face and it would never seem possible. Jerry had always looked for the easy way, the biggest deal, and he hadn't always been an admirable man. But he'd always been so full of life. Slowly, Jonas laid his hand on his brother's. There was no life there now, and nothing he could do; no amount of maneuvering or pulling of strings would bring it back. Just as slowly he removed his hand. It didn't seem possible, but it was.<br><br>Moralas nodded to the attendant. "I'm sorry."<br><br>Jonas shook his head. Pain was like a dull-edged knife through the base of his skull. He coated it with ice. "Who killed my brother, Captain?"<br><br>"I don't know. We're investigating."<br><br>"You have leads?"<br><br></p><h2>Batman Incorporated Vol. 1: Demon Star (The New 52)</h2><p>Amazon Best Book of<b> </b>the Month selection!<br><br>Eisner Award-winning fan-favorite writer Grant Morrison concludes the Batman epic he began nearly a decade ago in BATMAN &amp; SON, pitting the entirity of Batman Incorporated against the Levianthan organization headed by the Dark Knight's former romantic interest Talia al Ghul.

I&#x2019;m here. I&#x2019;m finally here! After years of Olympic-level networking, Eddie had at long last made it&#x2014;he had been invited to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Strictly by invitation only, this prestigious event was the most elite schmoozefest on the planet.<br><br>Every January, the world&#x2019;s most important heads of state, politicians, philanthropists, CEOs, tech leaders, thought leaders, social activists, social entrepreneurs, and, of course, movie stars would descend upon this secluded ski resort high in the Swiss Alps in their private jets, check in to their luxurious hotels, put on their $5,000 ski jackets and ski boots, and engage in meaningful dialogues about such urgent issues as global warming and rising inequality.<br><br>And now Eddie was part of this ultraexclusive club. As the recently appointed senior executive vice chairman of Private Banking (Global) for the Liechtenburg Group, he now found himself standing in the middle of the futuristic auditorium at the Congress Centre, breathing in the rarefied air and catching slivers of his own reflection in the thin chrome leg of an auditorium chair. He was wearing his new bespoke Sartoria Ripense suit, which had been outfitted with an inner lining of ten-ply cashmere so that he never had to wear a ski jacket over it. His new Corthay squirrel suede chukkas had special rubber soles, so he would never slip on the slick Alpine streets. On his wrist was his newest horological acquisition&#x2014;a rose gold A. Lange &amp; S�hne Richard Lange &#x201c;Pour le M�rite,&#x201d; peeking out the precise amount from his sleeve cuff so other watchophiles would see what he was wearing. But most important of all was what he wore over this sartorial splendor&#x2014;a black lanyard at the end of which was attached a white plastic badge with his name printed in the middle: Edison Cheng.<br><br>Eddie fondled the slick plastic badge as if it were a jewel-encrusted amulet, personally bestowed on him by the God of Davos. This badge distinguished him from all the pee-ons at the conference. He wasn&#x2019;t some PR hack, journalist, or one of the common attendees. This white plastic badge with the blue line at the bottom meant that he was an official delegate.<br><br>Eddie glanced around the room at all the clusters of people in hushed conversations, trying to see which dictator, despot, or director he could recognize and connect with. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a tall Chinese man wearing a bright orange ski parka peeking in through the auditorium&#x2019;s side door, seemingly a little lost. Wait a minute, I know that guy. Isn&#x2019;t that Charlie Wu?<br><br>&#x201c;Oy&#x2014;Charlie!&#x201d; Eddie yelled, a little too loudly, as he rushed over toward Charlie. Wait till he sees my official delegate badge!<br><br>Charlie beamed at him in recognition. &#x201c;Eddie Cheng! Did you just get in from Hong Kong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I came from Milan, actually. I was at the men&#x2019;s fall fashion shows&#x2014;front-row seat at Etro.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wow. I guess being one of Hong Kong Tattle&#x2019;s Best Dressed Men is serious work, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Charlie quipped.<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, I made it into the Best Dressed Hall of Fame last year,&#x201d; Eddie replied earnestly. He gave Charlie a quick once-over, noticing that he was wearing khaki pants with cargo pockets and a navy blue pullover under his bright orange parka. What a pity&#x2014;he used to be so fashionable when he was younger, and now he&#x2019;s dressed like every other tech-geek nobody. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your badge, Charlie?&#x201d; Eddie asked, flashing his own proudly.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes, we&#x2019;re supposed to wear them at all times, aren&#x2019;t we? Thanks for reminding me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s somewhere buried in my messenger bag.&#x201d; Charlie dug around for a few seconds before fishing out his badge, and Eddie glanced at it, his curiosity morphing into shocked dismay. Charlie was holding an all-white badge affixed with a shiny holographic sticker. Fucky fuck, this was the most coveted badge! The one they only gave to world leaders! The only other person he had seen so far wearing that badge was Bill Clinton! How the fuck did Charlie get one? All he did was run Asia&#x2019;s biggest tech company!<br><br>Trying to mask his envy, Eddie blurted, &#x201c;Hey, are you attending my panel&#x2014;Apocalypse Asia: How to Secure Your Assets When the China Bubble Really Bursts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m actually on my way to give a talk to IGWEL.

What&#x2019;s your talk about?&#x201d; Eddie asked, thinking that he could somehow tag along with Charlie.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anything prepared, really. I think Angela Merkel and some of the Scandinavians just wanted to pick my brain.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then, Charlie&#x2019;s executive assistant, Alice, walked up to join them.<br><br>&#x201c;Alice, look who I found! I knew we&#x2019;d bump into someone from back home sooner or later,&#x201d; Charlie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Cheng, so nice to see you here. Charlie&#x2014;could I have a quick word?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Alice glanced at Eddie, who looked only too eager for her to continue while he was standing right there. &#x201c;Er . . . would you mind coming with me for a moment?&#x201d; she said diplomatically, guiding Charlie into a side reception room furnished with several lounge chairs and glass-cube coffee tables.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up? Are you still trying to recover from sitting at the same breakfast table with Pharrell?&#x201d; Charlie teased.<br><br>Alice smiled tensely. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a developing situation all morning, and we didn&#x2019;t want to disturb you until we knew more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, spit it out.&#x201d;<br><br>Alice took a deep breath before beginning. &#x201c;I just got the latest update from our head of security in Hong Kong. I don&#x2019;t quite know how to tell you this, but Chloe and Delphine are missing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean missing?&#x201d; Charlie was stunned&#x2014;his daughters were under round-the-clock surveillance, and their pickups and drop-offs were handled with military precision by his SAS-trained security team. Missing was not a variable in their lives.<br><br>&#x201c;Team Chungking was scheduled to pick them up outside Diocesan at 3:50 p.m., but the girls couldn&#x2019;t be located at the school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t be located . . .&#x201d; Charlie mumbled in shock.<br><br>Alice continued, &#x201c;Chloe didn&#x2019;t respond to any of her texts, and Delphine never showed up for choir at two. They thought maybe she sneaked off with her classmate Kathryn Chan to that frozen yogurt shop like she did last time, but then Kathryn turned up at choir practice and Delphine didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did either of them activate their panic codes?&#x201d; Charlie asked, trying to remain calm.<br><br>&#x201c;No, they didn&#x2019;t. Their phones both appear to have been deactivated, so we can&#x2019;t trace them. Team 2046 has already spoken with Commander Kwok&#x2014;the Hong Kong police have been placed on high alert. We also have four of our own teams searching everywhere for them, and the school is now reviewing all their security-camera footage with Mr. Tin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m assuming someone&#x2019;s talked to their mother?&#x201d; Charlie&#x2019;s wife&#x2014;from whom he was estranged&#x2014;lived in their house on The Peak, and the children spent every other week with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Isabel can&#x2019;t be reached. She told the housekeeper that she was meeting her mother for lunch at the Kowloon Cricket Club, but her mother reports that they haven&#x2019;t spoken all week.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then, the cell phone rang again and Alice quickly answered. She listened in silence, nodding her head every now and then. Charlie looked at her pensively. This couldn&#x2019;t be happening. This couldn&#x2019;t be happening. Ten years ago his brother Rob had been kidnapped by the Eleven Finger Triad. It was like d�j� vu all over again.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Tor jeh, tor jeh,&#x201d; Alice said, hanging up. Looking at Charlie, she reported, &#x201c;That was the leader of Team Angels. They now think that Isabel might have left the country. They spoke to the upstairs maid, and Isabel&#x2019;s passport is missing. But for some reason she didn&#x2019;t take any suitcases.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she in the middle of some new treatment?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but apparently she didn&#x2019;t show up at her psychiatrist appointment this week.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie let out a deep sigh. This wasn&#x2019;t a good sign.<br><br>CHAPTER TWO<br><br>fullerton hotel, singapore<br><br>Every month, Rosalind Fung, the property heiress, hosted a Christian Fellowship Banquet for three hundred of her closest girlfriends in the opulent ballroom of the Fullerton Hotel. An invitation to this occasion was highly coveted by a certain segment of Singapore society regardless of their religious affiliation as it was a seal of approval from the old guard (there wasn&#x2019;t a single Chindo or Mainlander in sight), and also because the food was heavenly&#x2014;Rosalind brought in her personal chefs, who took over the hotel&#x2019;s kitchens for one day and prepared an enormous buffet feast consisting of the most mouthwatering Singaporean dishes. Most important&#x2014;this biblical bacchanal was completely free of charge thanks to Rosalind&#x2019;s generosity, although guests were asked to contribute something to the offering basket immediately following the closing prayer.<br><br>Having strategically chosen a table closest to the buffet area, Daisy Foo sighed as she watched Araminta Lee standing in line at the noodle station dishing out some mee siam. &#x201c;Aiyah&#x2014;that Araminta! Bein kar ani laau!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t look old. She just doesn&#x2019;t have any makeup on, that&#x2019;s all. Those supermodel types look like nothing on earth without makeup,&#x201d; Nadine Shaw said as she tucked into her steaming bowl of mee rebus noodles.<br><br>Dousing her mee goreng with more chili oil, Eleanor Young commented, &#x201c;It has nothing to do with that. I used to see her swim at the Churchill Club, and even when she was coming out of the pool dripping wet, she looked beautiful without a stitch of makeup on. Her face has just taken a turn, that&#x2019;s all. She has one of those faces that I always knew would age badly. What is she . . . twenty-seven, twenty-eight now? It&#x2019;s all over for her, lah.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, Lorena Lim and Carol Tai arrived at the table with plates piled dangerously high with food. &#x201c;Wait, wait . . . who&#x2019;s aging badly?&#x201d; Lorena inquired eagerly.<br><br>&#x201c;Araminta Lee. Over at that table with all the Khoo women. Doesn&#x2019;t she look haggard?&#x201d; Nadine said.<br><br>&#x201c;Alamak, bite your tongue, Nadine! Didn&#x2019;t you know she just had a miscarriage?&#x201d; Carol whispered.<br><br>The ladies all stared at Carol, mouths agape. &#x201c;Again? Are you joking? Who told you, lah?&#x201d; Daisy demanded, still chewing on her mee pok.<br><br>&#x201c;Who else? Kitty, lor. Kitty and Araminta are the best of friends now, and ever since this latest miscarriage, she&#x2019;s been spending a lot of time at Kitty&#x2019;s house playing with Gisele. She&#x2019;s completely heartbroken.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How often do you see Kitty and Gisele?&#x201d; Lorena asked, marveling that Carol could be so forgiving of her ex-daughter-in-law&#x2014;the same woman who had cheated on her son, Bernard, with a man Kitty met at the funeral of Carol&#x2019;s late husband and who subsequently dragged Bernard through a particularly acrimonious divorce and custody battle. (Of course, it didn&#x2019;t hurt that Carol abhorred her son&#x2019;s new lifestyle of yoga and &#x201c;that ridiculous Jurassic diet,&#x201d; both of which she considered to be satanic.)<br><br>&#x201c;I go over to Kitty&#x2019;s at least once a week, and Gisele comes to church with me every Sunday,&#x201d; Carol proudly reported.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it healthy for Araminta to be playing with your granddaughter when she just lost her own baby?&#x201d; Nadine wondered out loud.<br><br>&#x201c;Aiyah, I&#x2019;m sure old Mrs. Khoo must be giving Araminta soooo much pressure to produce a grandson! It&#x2019;s been five years since she married Colin! My Nicky and Rachel have been married for two years now, and they still won&#x2019;t give me a grandchild!&#x201d; Eleanor complained.<br><br>&#x201c;But Araminta is still young. She has plenty of time, lah,&#x201d; Nadine argued.<br><br>&#x201c;With all of Dorothy Khoo&#x2019;s side disinherited, Puan&#x2019;s side good-for-nothings, and Nigel Khoo running off and marrying that Russian cabaret singer, who is obviously too old to seh kiah, Colin and Araminta are the last hope to carry on the Khoo name,&#x201d; Daisy commented. Having been born a Wong, of the tin-mining Wongs, Daisy had an encyclopedic knowledge of Singapore&#x2019;s social history.<br><br>The ladies all shook their heads, casting pitiful glances at Araminta, who to anyone else but these women&#x2019;s hypercritical eyes looked perfectly gorgeous and lovely in her yellow striped minidress from Jacquemus.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Eleanor, your niece Astrid just arrived. There&#x2019;s one girl who never seems to age,&#x201d; Carol observed.<br><br>All the women turned to look as Astrid descended the sweeping curved staircase with her mother, Felicity Leong; the society queen Mrs. Lee Yong Chien; and another elderly lady decked out in a cobalt blue sequined hijab.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is that Malay woman wearing that ginormous ruby choker? If that center stone looks as big as it does from here, it must be the size of a lychee up close!&#x201d; Lorena exclaimed. Having been married into the L&#x2019;Orient Jewelry family for more than three decades, she definitely knew her rocks.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh that&#x2019;s the Dowager Sultana of Perawak. She&#x2019;s staying with the Leongs, of course,&#x201d; Eleanor reported.<br><br>&#x201c;Alamak, having royalty as houseguests is such a nuisance!&#x201d; Daisy complained.<br><br>Lorena, like most of the other women in the ballroom, scrutinized Astrid from head to toe as she walked to her table wearing what appeared to be a crisp men&#x2019;s button-down shirt tucked into exquisitely cut navy-and-white gingham cigarette trousers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true, Astrid actually looks younger and younger every time I see her. Isn&#x2019;t she in her late thirties by now? She looks like an MGS girl coming off the school bus! I bet you she must be sneaking off somewhere and getting things done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can tell you she hasn&#x2019;t had a thing done. She&#x2019;s not the type,&#x201d; Eleanor said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s how she puts it all together. The other girls her age are dressed up like Christmas trees but just look at Astrid . . . hair in a sleek ponytail, ballet flats, not a drop of jewelry except that cross . . . is it turquoise? And that outfit! She looks like Audrey Hepburn on the way to a screen test,&#x201d; Daisy said approvingly as she fished around in her new C�line handbag for a toothpick. &#x201c;Blah-dee-hell! See what my snobby daughter-in-law forces me to carry? She gave me this fancy handbag for my birthday because she&#x2019;s embarrassed of being seen next to me when I&#x2019;m carrying my no-name purse, but I can&#x2019;t ever find anything in here! It&#x2019;s so damn deep, and there are so many damn pockets!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Daisy, will you please stop swearing? We are in the Lord&#x2019;s presence tonight, you know,&#x201d; Carol admonished.<br><br>As if on cue, the Christian Fellowship Banquet&#x2019;s hostess, Rosalind Fung, got up from her table and walked onto the stage. A short, plumpish woman in her mid-sixties with a frizzy spiral perm, Rosalind was dressed in what seemed to be the regulation uniform of every middle-aged old-money Singaporean heiress&#x2014;a sleeveless floral blouse, probably purchased from the clearance rack at John Little, taupe elastic-waist pants, and orthopedic open-toe sandals. She smiled happily from the podium at her gathered friends.</p><h2>Sense and Sensibility: An Amish Retelling of Jane Austen&#39;s Classic (The Amish Classics)</h2><p>Henry Detweiler dies unexpectedly, leaving his second wife and three daughters, Eleanor, Mary Ann, and Maggie, in the care of John, his oldest son from a previous marriage.

Willig&#39;s fifth installment in her Pink Carnation series also involves espionage amid the Napoleonic era. Historical details like those about mad King George and opium-fueled orgies add real intrigue to this story.

Enjoy Claire Waldoff's rendering of a lower-class Berliner, Kurt Tucholsky's satirical songs, and Walter Mehring's Dadaist experiments, as Peter Jelavich spotlights Berlin's cabarets from the day the curtain first went up, in 1901, until the Nazi regime brought it down.</p><p>Fads and fashions, sexual mores and political ideologies--all were subject to satire and parody on the cabaret stage. This book follows the changing treatment of these themes, and the fate of cabaret itself, through the most turbulent decades of modern German history: the prosperous and optimistic Imperial age, the unstable yet culturally inventive Weimar era, and the repressive years of National Socialism. By situating cabaret within Berlin's rich landscape of popular culture and distinguishing it from vaudeville and variety theaters, spectacular revues, prurient "nude dancing," and Communist agitprop, Jelavich revises the prevailing image of this form of entertainment.</p><p>Neither highly politicized, like postwar German <i>Kabarett</i>, nor sleazy in the way that some American and European films suggest, Berlin cabaret occupied a middle ground that let it cast an ironic eye on the goings-on of Berliners and other Germans. However, it was just this satirical attitude toward serious themes, such as politics and racism, that blinded cabaret to the strength of the radical right-wing forces that ultimately destroyed it. Jelavich concludes with the Berlin cabaret artists' final performances--as prisoners in the concentration camps at Westerbork and Theresienstadt.</p><p>This book gives us a sense of what the world looked like within the cabarets of Berlin and at the same time lets us see, from a historical distance, these lost performers enacting the political, sexual, and artistic issues that made their city one of the most dynamic in Europe.</p></p><p>Peter Jelavich is Professor of History, University of Texas at Austin.The definitive account of the German capital's club and revue circuit from its origins around 1900 to its terrible coda in the transit camps, where performers would play for chuckling SS commandants before they were sent to their deaths. (<i>New Statesman and Society</i>)<br><br>[A] wonderful book...Berlin cabaret...was embedded in Berlin intellectual life. Jelavich's documentation of these relationships offers a great gift to historians of German culture--indeed to all historians of modern Germany. (Barbara Miller Lane <i>Central European History</i>)<br><br>Jelavich makes an important contribution to the study of cultural history. (James L. Zychowicz <i>Monatshefte</i>)<br><br>The reader is transported clearly and smoothly on a fascinating journey through the history of an urban art form that was strongly stimulated by some of the same forces that gave rise to the [Berlin-focused] publications...Covering a period of almost half a century, from the founding of Ernst von Wolzogen's Motley Theater in 1901 through performances by inmates of concentration camps during the Second World War, Jelavich makes an especially valuable contribution to the analysis of culture in an urban context. (Andrew Lees <i>Culture in Modern Germany</i>)<br><br>Peter Jelavich first explored the development of aesthetic modernism in <i>Munich and Theatrical Modernism</i> (1987). His superb new book carries this inquiry into the more complex and variegated life of Germany's political and cultural capital...Jelavich has contributed significantly to our understanding of modernist culture and its metropolitan context. He illuminates every subject he touches upon: the intersection of elite and popular art in the development of aesthetic modernism, the history of popular theater in Berlin, the city's cultural politics, and the broader social and political history of Germany. Like the best of cabarets, this book enlightens and entertains. (Warren Breckman <i>Journal of Social History</i>)<br><br>[A] well-written and clearly organized book that displays all the hallmarks of a comprehensive standard work and reference source, rich in information that entices further investigation. (Frederick A. Lubich <i>Germanic Review</i>)<br><br>Peter Jelavich has dismantled many legends about the politics of popular entertainments in his fine history, <i>Berlin Cabaret</i>. (Anthony Grafton <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Like the eloquent conf�renciers who comment on the cabaret acts that are his subject here, Jelavich expertly takes readers in hand, introduces them to the exuberant affairs of Berlin, and does so in a witty and insightful fashion...A great achievement. (Peter Fritzsche <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Jelavich has set the stage in a masterful work on the interaction between culture and commerce and the relatedness of decadence and exuberance as manifest in the <i>Berlin cabaret</i>. It was no mere frivolity but a legitimate expression--see Walter Benjamin and Georg Simmel's observations on the big city-see indeed Friedrich Nietzsche's Dionysian exhilaration--of a diversity and fragmentation that conditioned life in the Berlin metropolis. Jelavich clearly has had fun collecting all the evidence on the cabaret, and as he unfolds the story of its proponents, the texts of skits and songs and police reports, he succeeds in moving a seeming fringe phenomenon into the center of political and cultural dialogue of the big city whose idiosyncrasies he has recaptured with skill. The scholarship is impeccable, the writing is elegant; the author's fascination with his subject is contagious to the fellow-scholar as well as, I imagine, to all readers. (Klemens Von Klemperer, Smith College)<br><br>In this well-written book, Peter Jelavich has tracked down cabaret openings, closings, and programs, and discusses politics and personalities. His writing makes the history of Berlin cabarets come alive in a very special way. I found myself increasingly fascinated with the 'showtime' experiences, both on-stage and back-stage.

Why do we mistrust people more in the UK than in Japan? Why do Americans have higher rates of teenage pregnancy than the French? What makes the Swedish thinner than the Australians? The answer: inequality. This groundbreaking book, based on years of research, provides hard evidence to show: <ul> <li>How almost everything - from life expectancy to mental illness, violence to illiteracy - is affected not by how wealthy a society is, but how equal it is</li> <li>That societies with a bigger gap between rich and poor are bad for everyone in them - including the well-off </li> <li>How we can find positive solutions and move towards a happier, fairer future</li> <ul> Urgent, provocative and genuinely uplifting, The Spirit Level has been heralded as providing a new way of thinking about ourselves and our communities, and could change the way you see the world.

Young dinosaur enthusiasts will learn about the restless life of hungry meat-eaters and the perilous life of the plant eaters. They will discover how paleontologists gathered the fossils and what they can learn from the contents of a dinosaur's stomach. Dougal Dixon inspires the paleontologist in all children with full-color illustrations and diagrams mixed with bite-sized pieces of information. Basic facts accompany each dinosaur, including size, weight, favorite food, and the pronunciation of the name. <i>Dougal Dixon's Amazing Dinosaurs </i>encourages children to visualize the Age of Dinosaurs, while exploring basic theories and facts.</p><p><b>Dougal Dixon </b>is an international authority on dinosaurs. He is the author of more than twenty books about dinosaurs, including <i>Dougal Dixon's Dinosaurs, </i>which is published worldwide in eighteen international editions. He lives in England.``The biggest, the tallest, the toughest, the smallest. Dinosaur expert Dougal Dixon doesn't disappoint in this large-sized, extensively illustrated title intended for younger readers than his Dougal Dixon's Dinosaurs (1998). Dixon introduces meat-eaters, plant-eaters, armored, and two-footed plant eaters. Over 70 dinosaurs are featured with illustrations and fact boxes, providing the scientific name, classification, range, size, and time period. There are drawings of dinosaur anatomy inside and out; and dozens of dinosaur duos in battle. Dinosaur enthusiasts will enjoy spotting the many illustrations taken from past titles written by Dixon: here's Troodon, last seen on the cover of Dougal Dixon's Dinosaurs; there's Psittacosaurus in the latter title. This title includes an interesting new section on the bird-like Archaeopteryx and fossil animals ``part bird and part dinosaur,'' as well as non-dinosaur flying reptiles, called pterosaurs. Since the author does not give the date on any dinosaur discoveries, it is difficult to tell when texts or fact boxes have been updated. The author concludes with a ``Do you know?'' section, glossary, index, and books to read. Bigger type, less text, and the same dramatic full-color paintings as previous titles will make this a winner with younger dinosaur enthusiasts. A bargain.

Its residents are garbage recyclers, construction workers and economic migrants, all of them living in the hope that a small part of India&#39;s booming future will eventually be theirs. But when a crime rocks the slum community and global recession and terrorism shocks the city, tensions over religion, caste, sex, power, and economic envy begin to turn brutal.

Published by the Westminster Press, measures 9 1/4&#34; by 6 1/2&#34; by 1/2&#34;, a 128 page First Paperback reprint, with all the original Victorian script and illustrations; all copy is framed by the original decorative borders. Charles Dicken&#39;s own version of the life of Jesus Christ, as written for his children and grandchildren.</p><p>Charles Dickens wrote <i>The Life of Our Lord</i> around the same time he was finishing up <i>David Copperfield</i>, but to readers raised on a diet of Dickensian wit and indignation, his rendering of Jesus' life may come as something of a surprise. You won't find even the shadow of a Micawber or a Mrs. Gamp anywhere in this brief volume; no Pecksniffs, Podsnaps, or Mulberries, either. Instead, Dickens approaches his subject with simple reverence, retelling the New Testament in a manner suitable for his own young children--who were, in fact, his only intended audience. Indeed, he strictly forbade publication of <i>The Life</i> during his lifetime and begged his sister to make sure that they "would never even hand the manuscript, or a copy of it, to anyone to take out of the house." It wasn't until the death of Dickens's last living son that the manuscript was finally published in 1934. Though he left his trademark comedy behind, Dickens's liberal social conscience is still evident in what he chooses to emphasize about Jesus: "My Dear Children," he begins, <blockquote>I am very anxious that you should know something about the History of Jesus Christ. For everybody ought to know about Him. No one ever lived who was so good, so kind, so gentle, and so sorry for all people who did wrong, or were in any way ill or miserable, as He was.</blockquote> This is a simple, straightforward account of Jesus' life and teachings, with an occasional touch of whimsy: "You never saw a locust, because they belong to that country near Jerusalem, which is a great way off. So do camels, but I think you have seen a camel. At all events, they are brought over here, sometimes; and if you would like to see one, I will show you one." Occasionally, Victorian attitudes and prejudices creep through--Dickens writes that the Jewish Sabbath was Sunday, that Jews were "very ignorant and passionate," and also that "they were very proud, and believed that no people were good but themselves." Fortunately, such comments are few and far between, and for the most part the author focuses on the miracles Jesus performed and on the lessons in charity, forgiveness, and compassion that Christians can take away from them. This may not be among the greatest of Charles Dickens's literary accomplishments, but it is certainly one of his most heartfelt. <i>--Sheila Bright</i>Charles Dickens wrote The Life of Our Lord during the years 1846-1849, just about the time he was completing David Copperfield. In this charming, simple retelling of the life of Jesus Christ, adapted from the Gospel of St. Luke, Dickens hoped to teach his young children about religion and faith. Since he wrote it exclusively for his children, Dickens refused to allow publication.<p>For eighty-five years the manuscript was guarded as a precious family secret, and it was handed down from one relative to the next. When Dickens died in 1870, it was left to his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth. From there it fell to Dickens's son, Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, with the admonition that it should not be published while any child of Dickens lived.</p><p>Just before the 1933 holidays, Sir Henry, then the only living child of Dickens, died, leaving his father's manuscript to his wife and children. He also bequeathed to them the right to make the decision to publish The Life of Our Lord. By majority vote, Sir Henry's widow and children decided to publish the book in London. In 1934, Simon &amp; Schuster published the first American edition, which became one of the year's biggest bestsellers.</p></p><h2>Antiques to Die For</h2><p>When the body of a lively new acquaintance, Rosalie Chaffee, washes up on New Hampshire&#39;s rugged coastline, antiques dealer Josie Prescott is pulled into the mystery.

Paige can&#39;t tell Josie what exactly they&#39;re looking for. All her sister told her before she died was that it was worth a lot of money, and Paige fears greedy relatives are already scheming. As suspicion falls on the victim&#39;s boss, the CEO of a modular furniture company about whom Rosalie was penning a biography, the mystery deepens. Soon, an illicit love affair, a devious wife, an old diary and a threatening stalker steer Josie closer to the truth -- and a killer surprise.</p><p></p><h2>BBQ USA: 425 Fiery Recipes from All Across America</h2><p>Steven Raichlen, a national barbecue treasure and author of The Barbecue!

The stories are mostly about crime, violence and urban life. Contributors include Eduardo Risso, Phil Hester, Alex Maleev, Michael Avon Oeming and Eric Canete. The book is classed as sci-fi/noir, but the genre trappings are often overshadowed by the obvious fun contributors are having drawing robots. There are plenty of concepts, but most stories take familiar conventions, like the petty thieves holed up with cops outside, and simply populate them with metal people. One of the best of these is the story of a squealer by Frank Beaton and Ben Templesmith. Less typical standouts include a quiet story about urban interaction by Neal Shaffer and Ryan Brown, Jim Rugg's tale about a pigeon-keeper and one by Miles Gunter and Lakota Sioux appreciating the strangers a city-dweller sees.

For most of the past twenty centuries, important historical context for the debate has been supplied by the relation (or "counterpoint") between two monumental texts: Plato's <i>Timaeus</i> and the <i>Book of Genesis</i>.In <i>What Has Athens to Do with Jerusalem?</i>, Jaroslav Pelikan examines the origins of this counterpoint. He reviews the central philosophical issues of origins as posed in classical Rome by Lucretius, and he then proceeds to an examination of <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Genesis,</i> with <i>Timaeus'</i> Plato representing Athens and <i>Genesis'</i> Moses representing Jerusalem. He then follows the three most important case studies of the counterpoint--in the Jewish philosophical theology of Alexandria, in the Christian thought of Constantinople, and in the intellectual foundations of the Western Middles Ages represented by Catholic Rome, where <i>Timaeus</i> would be the only Platonic dialogue in general circulation.Whatever Plato may have intended originally in writing <i>Timaeus</i>, it has for most of the intervening period been read in the light of <i>Genesis</i>. Conversely, <i>Genesis</i> has been known, not in the original Hebrew, but in Greek and Latin translations that were seen to bear a distinct resemblance to one another and to the Latin version of <i>Timaeus</i>. Pelikan's study leads to original findings that deal with Christian doctrine in the period of the church fathers, including the Three Cappadocians (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa) in the East, and in the West, Ambrose, Augustine, and Boethius. All of these vitally important authors addressed the problem of the "counterpoint," and neither they nor these primary texts can become fully intelligible without attention to the central issues being explored here.<i>What Has Athens to Do with Jerusalem?</i> will be of interest to historians, theologians, and philosophers and to anyone with interest in any of the religious traditions addressed herein.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Jaroslav Pelikan</b> is Sterling Professor Emeritus of History, Yale University and President of The American Academy of Arts and Sciences.". . . Pelikan's study is interesting and provides a good entrance point to issues of cosmogony and how they are addressed by the Greek, Hebrew, Hellenistic, and Christian traditions."<br>--David Rehm, Mount Saint Mary's College, <i>Ancient Philosophy</i>, Volume 19, 2000<br> (David Rehm, Mount Saint Mary's College <i>Ancient Philosophy</i> 2000-05-24)<br><br>"This volume is no less relevant than it is fascinating. The public school systems in the United States have throughout the twentieth century struggled with the so-called creation-evolution debate. The tension and 'counterpoint' between a theological and a philosophical/scientific account of the origin of the world and of the human race seems perennial. Pelikan goes to the root of this debate by pairing Moses and Plato in this intriguing review of <i>Genesis</i> and <i>Timaeus</i>. . . . The book is valuable for theological libraries and for research scholars in Patristics and Medieval Studies. Theologians interested in the doctrine of the Trinity will find Pelikan's final chapter especially interesting."<br>--<i>Faith &amp; Mission</i><br> (<i>Faith &amp; Mission</i> 1999-04-01)<br><br>"Pelikan brings his usual mastery and eloquence to each of these essays.

Fado sounds traverse the globe, on internationally marketed recordings, as the "soul" of Lisbon. A <i>fadista</i> might sing until her throat hurts, the voice hovering on the break of a sob; in moments of sung beauty listeners sometimes cry. Providing an ethnographic account of Lisbon's<i> </i>fado scene, Lila Ellen Gray draws on research conducted with amateur fado musicians, <i>fadistas</i>, communities of listeners, poets, fans, and cultural brokers during the first decade of the twenty-first century. She demonstrates the power of music to transform history and place into feeling in a rapidly modernizing nation on Europe's periphery, a country no longer a dictatorship or an imperial power. Gray emphasizes the power of the genre to absorb sounds, memories, histories, and styles and transform them into new narratives of meaning and "soul."</p><p><p>Lila Ellen Gray is Associate Professor of Music at Columbia University.</p>"<i>Fado Resounding</i> is an impressive and engaging book, one that will expand understanding of fado beyond Portugal. Lila Ellen Gray takes up a wide range of topics, discussing fado in relation to emotion, historical mythologies, gender, and the idea of 'soulfulness,' as well as Lisbon, national identity, and world music. This is a stimulating contribution to the anthropology of expressive cultural forms."&#x2014;<b>Jo�o Leal</b>, Universidade Nova de Lisboa<br><br>"Lila Ellen Gray positions Lisbon's amateur fado<i> </i>scene in terms of all the contestation about what fado is and where the action is taking place. This positioning is a unique and valuable contribution to music ethnography, and Gray does major and convincing intellectual work arguing for 'amateur' scenes as paths into the deepest musical and ethnographic understandings of genre, style, performance, poesis, and the ways that sociality is lived and experienced through sound."&#x2014;<b>Steven Feld</b>, author of <i>Jazz Cosmopolitanism in Accra: Five Musical Years in Ghana</i><br><br>"Lila Ellen Gray&#x2019;s <i>Fado Resounding: Affective Politics and Urban Life</i> has the feel of a magnum opus. Ambitious in its breadth, it is clear from the get-go that this study is no small undertaking. Indeed, this is the first full-length ethnography of Portuguese fado published in English.... Lila Ellen Gray&#x2019;s many years of good, old-fashioned fieldwork... has produced a highly nuanced, original contribution to knowledge around Portugal&#x2019;s legendary 'national song.'" (Kimberly DaCosta Holton <i>Ellipsis</i>)<br><br><i>"Fado Resounding</i>&nbsp;is a powerful ethnographic account in which Lila Ellen Gray argues compellingly that the musical genre of fado performs invaluable labors in locating, synthesizing and activating modes of experience, expression and interaction....[The book]&nbsp;weaves together incredibly vivid ethnographic accounts with incisive analyses that will be of great use to scholars working on vocality and gender, as well as constructions and articulations of locality, history and genre." (Joshua Brown <i>Ethnomusicology Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Fado Resounding</i>, Gray makes a compelling response. Her study of fado stands out in making the intangible tangible, finding resonance across time and place, and locating fado&#x2019;s meaning as genre, as soul, as Lisbon.&#x201d; (Danielle M.

Then, in July 1971, Henry Kissinger arrived secretly in Beijing on a mission which quickly led to the reopening of relations between China and the West and changed the course of post-war history. For the past forty years, Kissinger has maintained close relations with successive generations of Chinese leaders, and has probably been more intimately connected with China at the highest level than any other western figure. This book distils his unique experience and long study of the &#39;Middle Kingdom&#39;, examining China&#39;s history from the classical era to the present day, and explaining why it has taken the extraordinary course that it has. The book concentrates on the decades since 1949, presenting brilliantly drawn portraits of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders, and reproducing verbatim Kissinger&#39;s conversations with each of them. But Kissinger&#39;s eye rarely leaves the long continuum of Chinese history: he describes the essence of China&#39;s approach to diplomacy, strategy and negotiation, and the remarkable ways in which Communist-era statesmen have drawn on methods honed over millennia. At the end of the book, Kissinger reflects on these attitudes for our own era of economic interdependence and an uncertain future. &#34;On China&#34; is written with great authority, complete accessibility and with many wider reflections on statecraft and diplomacy distilled from years of experience. At a moment when the rest of the world is thinking about China more than ever before, this timely book offers insights that no other can.</p><p>Henry Kissinger served as National Security Advisor and then Secretary of State under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and has advised many other American presidents on foreign policy. He received the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Medal of Liberty, among other awards.

He was a well-known biographer and children&#39;s writer, and worked previously as a producer at the BBC. He wrote biographies of J. R. R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten, Ezra Pound, C. S. Lewis and Dennis Potter. Among his many books for children were the best-selling Mr Majeika series. He also wrote several plays for the theatre and radio. A keen musician, he was a member of a 1930s-style jazz band, Vile Bodies, which was resident at the Ritz Hotel in London for a number of years. He died in 2005.A first-rate, if somewhat less than magisterial, treatment by Carpenter (The Brideshead Generation, 1990, etc.) of the life and works of one of the 20th century's towering musical figures--the man who put English music firmly on the larger European map. This is like a run-through of a great symphony by a major orchestra under a more-than-adequate international conductor. All the notes--Carpenter's prodigious research--are firmly in place. The major themes--Britten's overly doting relationship with his mother; his artistic preoccupation with the loss of innocence, which may have stemmed from childhood sexual abuse; his homosexual ``marriage'' to Peter Pears; his indiscrete relationships with young boys; his pacifism; his generosity and his selfishness; his depression and physical illnesses, all transcended by a phenomenal artistic (and especially compositional) energy that allowed him to turn out a staggering series of major and minor works in an unusually full 63 years of life--are crisp, clear, and skillfully played. Above all, Carpenter's respect for the intelligence of his readers shines through, causing him to eschew facile interpretation. And yet. Not only is the narrative overlong (much incidental detail), but the final stamp of passionate identification with the subject is absent. Britten's sparse anecdotes about homosexual rape by a schoolmaster, for example, are handled with exquisite discretion but lead to only a jarring, unnecessary inquiry (``Could they have both been fantasies on Britten's part, sparked off while his imagination was at work on his operas?''). Even readers who answer ``Not bloody likely'' have a right to the author's judgment on such matters. Not written merely from the card index--the book's a good deal better than that, and will be required reading by anyone seriously interested in its subject. But the sense that Carpenter has put his heart into perfect sync with Britten's own faulty organ isn't there. (Three 16-page photo inserts--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A waitress barely scraping by on Depression-era tips, she wanted more, and she saw her chance when she witnessed her first wrestling match. Even against all odds, she knew that she could become a female wrestler. What followed was a gritty, glittering testament to the golden age of wrestling, when beauty and brawn captivated the world.</p><p>Jeffrey Leen is the assistant managing editor for the <i>Washington Post&#x2019;s</i> investigations unit, where his work has helped win six Pulitzer Prizes. Also the author of <i>KINGS OF COCAINE</i>, the first book-length investigation of Columbia&#x2019;s Medellin cartel, he lives in Maryland.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Mark Adams Wrestling comes in two varieties: the genuine, boring kind practiced since Milo of Croton's heyday in the 6th century B.C., and the fake, wildly entertaining sort that created Hulk Hogan and resurrected Mickey Rourke's acting career. Likewise, the literature of the grappling arts can be split into two weight divisions: heavy treatises analyzing the methodology of the half-Nelson versus cotton-candy reminiscences of Spandexed superstars. Jeff Leen's fine new biography of the pioneering lady wrestler Mildred Burke, "The Queen of the Ring," might be in a class by itself. It's a serious history of one of this country's goofiest pastimes. Millie Bliss was a pregnant 18-year-old working at her mother's Kansas City restaurant in 1934 when salvation walked in. Squat, cauliflower-eared, desperately in need of orthodontia, Billy Wolfe was also a wife-beater, a thief and the sort of fellow remembered decades later for having arranged a girlfriend's sterilization while she underwent an appendectomy. Burke's attraction to him was practical. She wanted to wrestle, and Wolfe managed a troupe of lady grapplers. After ignoring Millie's pleas for months, he finally offered the new single mom a tryout -- against a man. She body-slammed her opponent in under a minute. In short order, Millie Bliss became Mildred Burke, then Mrs. Billy Wolfe, then one of the top female wrestlers in the Midwest. The not-exactly-happy couple barnstormed with a troupe that included teenagers, lesbians and eventually African American women. Wolfe, whose predatory libido matched his name, tried to bed every woman he employed -- and fined those he caught sleeping with other men. Burke took on all comers. She defeated men, she defeated women, she defeated her husband in his clumsy attempt to arrange a m�nage � trois. As her fame grew, she developed a signature look in the ring: white tights, full makeup and a Ginger Rogers coif. The glamour lasted only until the hair-pulling and hammerlocks commenced. Pro-wrestling fandom, of course, requires a suspension of disbelief longer than Andre the Giant's wingspan. Leen deftly describes the sporting world's soap opera as "a child of the carnival and a cousin of the long con," in which "deception is rife and determining facts is a fraught business." Thus, it is impossible to know if Mildred Burke's swift ascension to the throne of women's wrestling was attained by merit or arrangement. What was clear, however, was that Wolfe and Burke had created a phenomenon. Despite being banned in many major cities, women's matches drew 3 million customers in 1942. Leen is an investigative editor for The Washington Post, and as references to old census reports and dusty draft records accumulate, one senses that he's left no stone unturned in researching Burke's story. The early chapters, in which he piles on supporting evidence, sometimes have the feel of preliminary bouts before the main event. "The Queen of the Ring" comes alive, though, with the arrival of Burke's first great foil, Gladys "Killem" Gillem, the professional patsy whose chances of beating Burke on any given evening were roughly equal to the Washington Generals' odds of upsetting the Harlem Globetrotters. Leen makes the case that while the matches were almost always fixed, it wasn't unknown for challengers to attempt a double-cross and steal the title. Burke's superior technical skills -- in particular, her deadly, thigh-powered "alligator clutch" -- helped her keep the title longer than Wolfe wanted her to. As a character, Burke is far less interesting than the charismatic monster Wolfe. (Her unpublished autobiography, which Leen cites heavily, seems to be another outlier in the wrestling canon: a colorless pro-wrestling tell-all.) But "Queen" is less Burke's tale than it is the rich story of the golden age of women's ring rivalries, and Leen unearths truckloads of wonderful details along the way: lady wrestlers in swimsuits sunning themselves on the fenders of moving cars between engagements; a reporter tallying the diamonds that Wolfe wears to one interview at 55 carats; Burke backstage combing out the blond locks of androgynous ring villain Gorgeous George and complaining that Wolfe has blacklisted her; George handing over $5,000 and urging her to "beat that son of a bitch." Cameos and anecdotes aside, though, when Leen knits pro wrestling into the larger culture, such as his exploration of the sport's relationship with the mushrooming medium of television, his tale soars like Hulk Hogan leaping from a turnbuckle. ("One promoter estimated that 90 percent of the TV wrestling audience was female," Leen writes.) The author even makes a plausible connection between Burke's fame and the rise of al-Qaeda. And as the narrative accelerates toward a good-versus-evil climax worthy of Wrestlemania, not even the most committed jihadist would dare miss how the story turns out. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Compiled over many years of work with the craftspeople, and with the cooperation of one of their main organizing bodies, the Indian Arts and Crafts Association, Mr. Wright has with this book both made a useful tool for identification and left an important record of the work of these talented people.

Pursuing a career-long obsession, author Britt Salvesen explores the origins and impact of the stereoscope, featuring historic images by Jules Duboscq, Oskar Fischinger, Salvador Dal�, and others. She traces the invention to the dawn of film, and then to its post-World War II iterations, such as the ViewMaster, lenticular printing, and holography. Readers learn how 3D photography became incorporated into the work of such artists as John Baldessari, Dan Graham, and Andy Warhol. Encompassing more than 100 years of innovation and experimentation, and covering a wide range of genres, artists, and forms--from sophisticated perceptual experimentation to popular cinema--this volume shows how the mystery of 3D images remain appealing to 21st-century artists and audiences. Each book includes 2 sets of glasses (one stereoscopic and one anaglyph), to enhance readers' appreciation of the possibilities in this multi-dimensional form of artistic expression.<br><b>Published in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art</b></p><p>BRITT SALVESEN is Curator and Head of the Wallis Annenberg Photography Department and the Prints and Drawings Department at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p><h2>The Complete Guide to Companion Planting: Everything You Need to Know to Make Your Garden Successful</h2><p><p>The idea of companion planting has arisen in the gardening community in recent years as an extremely viable new take on how plants should situated, grown, and cultivated.

Anyone who cares about journalism, about important national issues and the way the media addresses them, must read this book.<p> It has been said that Friendly and Edward R. Murrow invented television journalism; certainly their program <i>See It Now</i> set a standard for journalistic courage and principle that in many ways has rarely been equaled. After it was replaced by quiz shows that earned higher ratings, Friendly went on to produce other important news programming and, ultimately, became president of CBS News. He resigned in 1966 in protest when the network decided to run <i>I Love Lucy</i> reruns rather than Senate hearings on Vietnam, calling that decision "the most important act of my life." </p><p> The book closes with an impassioned plea for the creation of a commercial-free public television network that would be free from such pressures; Friendly was later involved in PBS public affairs programming. What he understood is that the use of the public airwaves is a privilege, not a right, and that it comes with serious responsibilities. As he wrote, "Each time that the FCC grants a radio or television license, those to whom it is awarded walk out with a medallion symbolizing service to all the people their station can reach ... commercial television has the resources and professional talent to do all the things that television should be doing, but because of its stockholders, it does not feel that it can often afford to appeal to excellence." The issues that concerned him are still crucial to television journalism today.</p><p> (The 1999 paperback edition includes a new foreword from Dan Rather, who worked for Friendly at CBS, and Tom Bettag, the executive producer of <i>Nightline</i> and a student of Friendly's at Columbia University.) <i>--Linda Killian</i></p>When Fred Friendly's powerful examination of broadcast news was published in 1967, it was judged by The New Yorker to be "an engrossing professional memoir." and it quickly leaped onto The New York Times bestseller list. Now reissued with a new Introduction by Dan Rather, anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News, and Tom Bettag, executive producer of Nightline, on the anniversary of Friendly's death, this discourse on the importance of television in society presents Friendly's uncannily prescient views on the corrosive effect of money on the news business, the sensationalization of news reporting, and the viewing public's appetite for quality broadcasting. <br>With Edward R. Murrow, Fred Friendly practically invented television journalism. Through telling anecdotes and penetrating analysis, he recalls his collaborations with Murrow, from their stinging documentary on Senator Joseph McCarthy to CBS's pioneering coverage of the burgeoning civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements. Friendly also recounts his resignation as president of CBS News in 1966, when the network ran reruns of I Love Lucy instead of Senate hearings on the war in Vietnam. Following that controversial decision, he began writing this memorable book.</p><h2>Mustang Aces of the Eighth Air Force (Aircraft of the Aces, 1)</h2><p>Unquestionably the best American fighter of World War 2, the North American P-51 Mustang served in large numbers with the USAAF&#39;s Eighth Air Force from late 1943 until VE Day, and was the mount of most aces in-theatre. Charged with the responsibility of escorting huge formations of B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers on daylight raids deep into Germany, the P-51 pilots of the various fighter groups within the &#39;Mighty Eighth&#39; went head to head with the cream of the Luftwaffe&#39;s fighter squadrons for control of the skies over the Third Reich.</p><p>Osprey&#39;s Aircraft of the Aces series combines full colour artwork, the best archival contemporary photography, and first hand accounts from aces to bring history&#39;s greatest airborne conflicts to life.Jerry Scutts has worked in the field of aviation publishing since the late 1960s, writing over 40 books that have covered a broad spectrum of subject matter ranging from US Navy floatplane fighters in World War 2 to the exploits of the USAF's Phantom IIs over Vietnam.

Lacking a pure understanding of the leader's life and work, the popular media has conflated Qutb's moral purpose with the aims of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. He is often portrayed as a terrorist, Islamo-Fascist, and advocate of murder. An expert on social protest and political resistance, John Calvert rescues Qutb from misrepresentation and follows the evolution of his thought within the context of his time.</p><p>Calvert recounts Qutb's life from the small village in which he was raised to his execution at the behest of Abd al-Nasser's regime. His study remains sensitive to the cultural, political, social, and economic circumstances that shaped Qutb's thought, including major developments that composed one of the most eventful periods in Egyptian history. These years witnessed the full flush of Britain's tutelary regime, the advent of Egyptian nationalism, and the political hegemony of the Free Officers. Qutb rubbed shoulders with Taha Husayn, Naguib Mahfouz, and Abd al-Nasser himself, though his Islamism originally had little to do with religion. Only in response to his harrowing experience in prison did Qutb come to regard Islam and kufr (infidelity) as oppositional, antithetical, and therefore mutually exclusive. Calvert shows how Qutb repackaged and reformulated the Islamic heritage to challenge authority, including those who claimed (falsely, Qutb believed) to be Muslim.</p></p><p><p>John Calvert is associate professor of history at Creighton University, Nebraska. He is the author of <i>Islamism: A Documentary and Reference Guide</i> and coeditor and translator of Sayyid Qutb's <i>A Child from the Village</i>. His research focuses on social protest and political resistance movements in the modern Middle East, as well as Egyptian nationalism and the ideological origins of al-Qaeda.</p><p>Given that Sayyid Qutb is taught on a large (and increasing) number of campuses, and given that he has already been introduced to the public in best-selling books, such as Lawrence Wright's <i>The Looming Tower</i>, the very publication of a Qutb biography should attract considerable interest. This book not only constitutes what is likely to remain the figure's definitive biography but also offers crucial new insights on the post-1954 history of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. We are dealing with a rare book that is likely to become a classic in the field of political Islam.

In 1967, at the age of twenty-three, no longer able to tolerate the grotesque iniquities and oppression of apartheid, she chose exile and emigrated to the United States. There she embraced feminism, met anti-apartheid and solidarity movement activists, and encountered a particularly American brand of racial injustice. Urdang also met African revolutionaries such as Amilcar Cabral, who would influence her return to Africa and her subsequent journalism. In 1974, she trekked through the liberation zones of Guinea-Bissau during its war of independence; in the 1980&#x2019;s, she returned repeatedly to Mozambique and saw how South Africa was fomenting a civil war aimed to destroy the newly independent country. From the vantage point of her activism in the United States, and from her travels in Africa, Urdang tracked and wrote about the slow, inexorable demise of apartheid that led to South Africa&#x2019;s first democratic elections, when she could finally return home.<br><br>Urdang&#x2019;s memoir maps out her quest for the meaning of home and for the lived reality of revolution with empathy, courage, and a keen eye for historical and geographic detail. This is a personal narrative, beautifully told, of a journey traveled by an indefatigable exile who, while yearning for home, continued to question where, as a citizen of both South Africa and the United States, she belongs. &#x201c;My South Africa!&#x201d; she writes, on her return in 1991, after the release of Nelson Mandela, &#x201c;How could I have imagined for one instant that I could return to its beauty, and not its pain?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Stephanie J. Urdang is the author of two books on Africa, including And Still They Dance: Women, War and the Struggle for Change in Mozambique.

The North Carolina Birding Trail is a driving trail linking birders and tourists with great birding sites across the state and the local communities in which they are found. <br><br>The third of three regional guides, the <i>Mountain Trail Guide</i> presents 105 premier birding destinations in the North Carolina mountains, from the Tennessee border in the west to Interstate 77 in the east.

Celan's poetry, inextricably linked with the memory of the Holocaust, has haunted Kiefer's work for more than twenty-five years and has influenced him on every level, from the naming of works and exhibitions to the incorporation of symbolic materials from Celan's imagery&#x2014;sand, straw, hair, and ashes&#x2014;into his paintings.<br><br>Like other German artists of his generation, Kiefer began by questioning his own artistic heritage, focusing on the iconographic and mythological elements of German culture that had been taken over by Nazi propaganda, and subsequently repressed and buried deep in the collective unconscious. It was his encounter with Celan's work in the early 1980s that first enabled him to escape from the vicious circle of fascination and disgust at the cultural ties that bound him to the Third Reich, leading him to confront the subject of the Holocaust and Jewish memory as a whole and to embrace this body of traditions within his art.<br><br>Magnificently illustrated throughout with reproductions of Kiefer's best-known works, this book explores the intricate web of associations between the poet and the painter, a network that is extended to embrace other artistic and literary figures such as Ingeborg Bachmann and Joseph Beuys. 157 illustrations, 140 in color.</p><p><b>Andr�a Lauterwein</b> was born in Zurich in 1969.

Burroughs)</p><h2>The Creation Hypothesis: Scientific Evidence for an Intelligent Designer</h2><p>Is there evidence from natural science for an intelligent creator of the universe? For a century the reigning scientific view has been that God is not necessary to account for the existence of the world and of life. Evolutionary theory is said to be all that is needed to explain how we got here. In addition, many theistic evolutionists contend that God likely used many of the mechanisms of evolution to achieve his will. In this book J. P. Moreland and a panel of scholars assert that there is actually substantial evidence pointing in a different direction. First, they consider philosophical arguments about whether it is possible for us to know if an intelligent designer had a hand in creation. Then they look directly at four different areas of science: the origin of life, the origin of major groups of organisms, the origin of human language and the origin and formation of the universe. The team of experts for this work includes a philosopher, a mathematician, a physicist, a linguist, a theologian, a biophysicist, an astronomer, a chemist and a paleontologist. Their data and their conclusions challenge the assumptions of many and offer the foundation for a new paradigm of scientific thinking.</p><p>J. P. Moreland (PhD, University of Southern California) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California. He is the author, coauthor, or contributor to over ninety-five books, including <em>Does God Exist?</em>, <em>Universals</em>, <em>The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology</em>, <em>Consciousness and the Existence of God</em>, <em>Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview</em>, <em>In Search of a Confident Faith</em>, <em>Love Your God With All Your Mind</em>, <em>The God Question</em>, and <em>Debating Christian Theism</em>.

Who cares that Fraser McConnel has worn the same ratty Converse sneakers for years and that his castle is really a pile of rubble -- all the social -climbing queen of preen cares about is the title she&#39;ll soon have. She&#39;s got Fraser by the nuptials, and she has no intention of letting go. Gentle, decent Fraser is completely innocent Amanda&#39;s wiles, so Mel and Fran, still smarting from Amanda&#39;s evil misdeeds years ago in school, join forces with Fraser&#39;s adorable younger brother Angus to sabotage the mismatch of the century. Between fighting off the attentions of a love-crazed accountant, dealing with a ne&#39;er-do-well rockstar wannabe boyfriend, keeping Fran&#39;s deadly maneuvers with the opposite sex under control, finding herself at the heart of a bachelor party controversy, consuminglarge quantities of alcohol, and throwing out hysterical barbs that would make Oscar Wilde proud, Mel will break some hearts and win over those of readers by the score...all of whom are certain to enjoy the mayhem -- and hilarious mishaps -- in store in &#34;Amanda&#39;s Wedding!&#34;</p><p>Jenny Colgan, a former journalist, used her stint as a stand-up comedian to perfect her material for this book. She recently completed her second novel, Talking to Addison.When snooty rich girl Amanda tells 20-something Melanie and her buddy Fran that she's marrying Frasier McConnel, laird of a run-down Scottish castle and an extremely sweet man, they know they must prevent the wedding. A series of barbed encounters, many of them drunken, ensues as Melanie, Fran, and Frasier's brother, Angus, attempt to forestall the nuptials. Tanya Eby reads in a high, squeaky, little-girl voice that is annoying, but not necessarily out of character. The men all have deep, gravelly voices, Scots included; the women are difficult to differentiate. Most amazing are the switches from smooth narrative to stilted phrasing complete with halts in unnatural places, which complement the inarticulate dialogue. Aside from the foul language and sharp British humor, the story is a predictable romance packed with humiliation, cruel humor, and a happy ending.

Jan Karon, purveyor of so-called "gentle fiction," continues the series that began with <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, in <i>Out to Canaan</i>. The patriarch of the tightly bound community of Mitford, North Carolina, is Father Timothy Kavanaugh, a.k.a. legal counsel, psychologist, foster parent, headhunter, husband, political analyst, and rector of his congregation. He is always there to lend a helping hand, a kind word or bit of advice, which believe it or not, makes for an incredibly busy schedule in this quiet, country town. <p> Longtime mayor Esther Cunningham, revered for preserving the traditions of the town, finds a formidable foe in Mack Stroupe, a free-spending industrialist who stands for the two most reviled words in Mitford: change and development.

"The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p><p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p><p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997.

M. W. Turner</h2><p>The extraordinary life of J. M. W Turner, one of Britain&#39;s most admired, misunderstood and celebrated artists J. M. W. Turner is Britain&#39;s most famous landscape painter. Yet beyond his artistic achievements, little is known of the man himself and the events of his life: the tragic committal of his mother to a lunatic asylum, the personal sacrifices he made to effect his stratospheric rise, and the bizarre double life he chose to lead in the last years of his life. A near-mythical figure in his own lifetime, Franny Moyle tells the story of the man who was considered visionary at best and ludicrous at worst. A resolute adventurer, he found new ways of revealing Britain to the British, astounding his audience with his invention and intelligence. Set against the backdrop of the finest homes in Britain, the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, this is an astonishing portrait of one of the most important figures in Western art and a vivid evocation of Britain and Europe in flux. Set against this spectacular and ultimately controversial career, Moyle also excavates the private Turner. Psychologically wounded as a child, by a family torn apart by death and mental illness, she suggests a man who could not embrace relationships fully until the very end of his life. Only then did he succumb to his love for the widowed Sophia Booth, concealing this all too human aspect of his life behind an assumed identity. She mines the poignancy of his final years, when, with his health ailing, Turner sought solace in a secret private life that had eluded him before and that he knew would scandalise the new generation of Victorians.</p><p>Franny Moyle studied Art History at St John&#39;s College, Cambridge. She enjoyed a career in arts programming at the BBC that culminated in her becoming the corporation&#39;s first Commissioner for Arts and Culture. She is now a freelance executive producer and writer and lives in east London. She is the author of Constance: The Tragic and Scandalous Life of Mrs Oscar Wilde and Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites.Moyle&#39;s superb biography rigorously tackles the myths surrounding Turner&#39;s life and presents a vivid portrait of a man whose ideas and behaviour were rooted in the 18th century - and whose work is too often taken out of context * Mail on Sunday * An exemplary work... Moyle explores the whole of his long life, expertly charting the artist&#39;s development from his precocious conquering of the Royal Academy to his late, experimental paintings. Moyle is especially good at delineating Turner&#39;s artistic methods and her enthralling account is filled with an impressive understanding of his unique talent. -- Ian Critchley * Sunday Times * A thorough, balanced and wonderfully fluent account. Franny Moyle [is] one of the best in the long line of [Turner&#39;s] biographers One of Turner&#39;s many achievements was to paint Britain in all its moods ... and show his peers the real nature and variety of their own country. In her immaculate biography Moyle has done something similar with the man himself. -- Michael Prodger * Times * Fresh and lively ... Turner&#39;s life is given a vivid colour and depth as Moyle deftly interweaves his professional career with his private life. Moyle writes with sensitivity about individual pictures and series, and is good at explaining the context -- Jenny Uglow * BBC History Magazine * Elegant and thorough. Moyle&#39;s superb evocation of these aspects of her subject allows us to see Turner less as the &#34;misunderstood genius&#34; who moved in a sphere untouched by the realities of the day, and &#34;more as an arch manipulator and central player in the great game of art that evolved across the late 18th and 19th centuries, a man praised to the hilt by a great many of his contemporaries [who] acknowledged his significance in the creation of the idea of the independent artist&#34;. It is to Moyle&#39;s credit that she is able to make this persuasive case while narrating Turner&#39;s life with verve, intelligence and insight, and while bringing to life the world in which he lived with care and subtlety. This is a biography that leaves you with a fresh impression of both Turner and his time. It frees its subjects from myth, and imbues them with the quality of wonder. -- Matthew Adams * I News * Moyle is good on Turner&#39;s momentous times, interweaving history, the history of art and the public&#39;s attitude toward art. -- Claudia Fitzherbert * Telegraph * It is hard, on one level, to believe his sublime canvases ... come with a character attached at all. But Moyle tells the human story well in a book of rigorous scholarship and beauty. She offers an earthy, warts-and-all depiction of the Romantic master JMW Turner that is shaped by the dogged realism of a low-born man who had an exceptional artistic vision. This is well written and meticulously researched. All we once had left of Turner were his paintings, now we have another vibrant biography to commemorate his art, and where it took us. -- Lorraine Courtenay * Irish Independent * Franny Moyle tells a compelling story of a self-taught prodigy... A restless painter who always sought new forms of expression in watercolour and oils. Moyle is an unpretentious art historian, and she has written an inviting and easily digested biography of the best of British painters -- Stephen Fay * Economist * Of the two recent books on Turner, Moyle&#39;s is the more satisfying, not least because it allows for the intimacy of reading. Less is more when it comes to biography - and Moyle gives Turner&#39;s restless life a perspective and a frame -- Frances Wilson * New Statesman * Very well researched . . . Moyle achieves an unusual level of empathy * Time Out (on &#39;Desperate Romantics&#39;) * Moyle&#39;s art-historical perceptions make this detailed and beautifully balanced biography a compelling read... Turner emerges from it larger... revealed as a man of his moment -- Brian Morton * Scottish Herald * The words on the page offer views every bit as captivating as Turner&#39;s ageless panoramas * Big Issue * A fat, satisfying popular history of the man who was arguably Britain&#39;s greatest painter * Financial Review * Miss Moyle tells a very good story. She is sound on the art without allowing art historicism to weigh her down. She is also excellent on the complicated politics of the Royal Academy. We get a feel for the man in all his cantankerousness and eccentricity, but she also brings out the humour and -at least after he had made his own fortune-the generosity, especially towards his fellow artists -- Huon Mallalieu * Country Life * Moyle is consistently perceptive about Turner&#39;s work, especially the way in which he sought to portray both what he could see in front of him and what he couldn&#39;t see - things like air and space. Her narrative is as colourful as it is pacy. -- John Preston * Daily Mail * What Ruskin misses, but Moyle writes about so persuasively, is Turner&#39;s ambition -- Laura Freeman * Mail on Sunday * Moyle is excellent at establishing these stylistic contexts. ... her art-historical perceptions are what make this detailed and beautifully balanced biography so compelling a read. It&#39;s rare that one finishes a modern biography feeling that the subject has been enhanced and not merely dissected. McKern and Spall can step aside.

THE SERIES EVERY CHINESE READER HAS BEEN ENJOYING FOR DECADES - 300 MILLION COPIES SOLD. China: 1200 A.D. The Song Empire has been invaded by its warlike Jurchen neighbours from the north. Half its territory and its historic capital lie in enemy hands; the peasants toil under the burden of the annual tribute demanded by the victors. Meanwhile, on the Mongolian steppe, a disparate nation of great warriors is about to be united by a warlord whose name will endure for eternity: Genghis Khan. Guo Jing, son of a murdered Song patriot, grew up with Genghis Khan&#39;s army. He is humble, loyal, perhaps not altogether wise, and is fated from birth to one day confront an opponent who is the opposite of him in every way: privileged, cunning and flawlessly trained in the martial arts. Guided by his faithful shifus, The Seven Heroes of the South, Guo Jing must return to China - to the Garden of the Drunken Immortals in Jiaxing - to fulfil his destiny. But in a divided land riven by war and betrayal, his courage and his loyalties will be tested at every turn.</p><p>Jin Yong is one of the world&#39;s bestselling writers, with more than 100 million of his works sold (not including unknown numbers of bootleg copies). He is beloved across China for his wuxia (&#34;martial arts and chivalry) novels, which have given rise to film, television, comic book and video game adaptations. He was awarded an O.B.E. in 1981, and is one of two authors on the MacLehose list who have asteroids named in their honour (the other being Georges Perec).[Jin Yong&#39;s] work, in the Chinese-speaking world, has a cultural currency roughly equal to that of &#34;Harry Potter&#34; and &#34;Star Wars&#34; combined . . .

The tale is like every fairy tale you&#39;re ever loved, imbued with jokes and epic grandeur.

You&#39;ll be rooting for the heroes to the end. -- Miriam McDonald * SFX * In Anna Holmwood&#39;s spirited translation, this action-packed and ideas-laden saga is as revealing of modern as of ancient China. * Economist * A stirring epic, full of gravity-defying kung fu, treachery, loyalty and love . . . hugely entertaining. -- Antonia Senior * The Times. * A Chinese Lord of the Rings. * Irish Times. * The world&#39;s biggest kung fu fantasy writer . . . Guo Jing, a young soldier among the massed ranks of Genghis Khan&#39;s invading army and son of a murdered warrior, may soon become as familiar a questing literary figure as Frodo Baggins from Tolkien&#39;s Lord of the Rings, or Jon Snow from Game of Thrones. -- Vanessa Thorpe * Observer. * The pace and drama is as swift and smooth as the intricate and detailed fighting scenes. This is the first in the series and I shall look forward to reading the second. * Historical Novel Review. * Jin Yong . . . is working with themes that are absolutely timeless - good versus evil, love versus sacrifice, nature versus nurture, honour versus deceit . . .

The poem&#39;s 1,046 lines concern the fulfillment of Buddha&#39;s prophecy. As well, they bear upon the timeless message that resonates through all ages -- man&#39;s irresistible longing for spiritual freedom. As such, here is meaning not only for those who have ever been inspired by the wisdom of Buddhism but anyone who ever sensed they were being swept along in the stream of time and wondered, if only for an instant, to where and for what.

The volume includes a nicely varied assortment of stories, from the delightful tongue-in-cheek humor of A. A.

R. F. Keating. While collections of American mystery "shorts" are rife, it's rarer to find collections by the Brits. This volume, with its outstanding representation of the most well known and popular British authors from the past century, is well worth adding to every mystery collection. <i>Emily Melton</i></p><h2>Conqueror&#39;s Kiss</h2><p>There is little hope for sanctuary in the midst of the tumultuous Scottish border wars, yet one woman may find safe refuge . . . in the arms of her sworn enemy . . . <br><br>Jennet Graeme has witnessed terrible tragedy during the many years of strife between the Scots and the English.

Offering more breadth than depth, the book is good for browsing, with plenty of color photographs to draw in readers. It's hard to think of a myth or mystery that isn't covered. The "Mysteries of the Past" section looks at Atlantis, Stonehenge, Easter Island, and Camelot, among others. There are also sections on the mysteries of nature (dowsing, feng shui, Bigfoot); the mysteries of space (Roswell, crop circles, alien abductions); mind and matter (ESP, psychics, Nostradamus); and religious questions, including mysteries of the Bible, miracles, and faith healing. The book ends with "The World Beyond," which deals with life after death. Individual topics, sometimes grouped together, are handled on two-page spreads. The typeface is small and often in white set against dark backgrounds, making it hard to read. Fortunately, the topics are fascinating enough to circumvent that pitfall. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But when the moment arrived in 1924, Brod could not bring himself to burn the unpublished works of the man he considered a literary genius&#x2015;even a saint. Instead, Brod devoted his life to championing Kafka&#x2019;s writing, rescuing his legacy from obscurity and physical destruction.</p><p>The story of Kafka&#x2019;s posthumous life is itself Kafkaesque. By the time of Brod&#x2019;s own death in Tel Aviv in 1968, Kafka&#x2019;s major works had been published, transforming the once little-known writer into a pillar of literary modernism. Yet Brod left a wealth of still-unpublished papers to his secretary, who sold some, held on to the rest, and then passed the bulk of them on to her daughters, who in turn refused to release them. An international legal battle erupted to determine which country could claim ownership of Kafka&#x2019;s work: Israel, where Kafka dreamed of living but never entered, or Germany, where Kafka&#x2019;s three sisters perished in the Holocaust?</p><p>Benjamin Balint offers a gripping account of the controversial trial in Israeli courts&#x2015;brimming with dilemmas legal, ethical, and political&#x2015;that determined the fate of Kafka&#x2019;s manuscripts. Deeply informed, with sharply drawn portraits and a remarkable ability to evoke a time and place, <em>Kafka&#x2019;s Last Trial</em> is at once a brilliant biographical portrait of a literary genius, and the story of two countries whose national obsessions with overcoming the traumas of the past came to a head in a hotly contested trial for the right to claim the literary legacy of one of our modern masters.</p></p><p><strong>Benjamin Balint</strong> is a research fellow at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem.

Who should inherit Franz Kafka? The woman into whose hands his manuscripts fortuitously fell? Germany, the nation that murdered his sisters but claims his spirit? Israel, asserting a sovereign yet intimate ancestral right? Searing questions of language, of personal bequest, of friendship, of biographical evidence, of national pride, of justice, of deceit and betrayal, even of metaphysical allegiance, burn through Balint&#x2019;s scrupulous trackings of Kafka&#x2019;s final standing before the law.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cynthia Ozick, author of <em>Foreign Bodies</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Thrilling and profound, <em>Kafka&#x2019;s Last Trial</em> shines new light not only on the greatest writer of the twentieth century and the fate of his work, but also on the larger question of who owns art or has a right to claim guardianship of it.

To write about you the veteran s spouse or partner is to write about another kind of loyalty and perseverance and yet another kind of pain and sadness. The trauma of war can affect not only the warriors, but their partners and children as well. Often it is you, the veteran s partner, who helps sustain the veteran during his or her depressions, anxiety attacks, and post-traumatic reactions. It may also be you, and perhaps you alone, who has sustained your veteran s will to live during his or her most anguished moments. Unfortunately, some veterans vent their anger (at themselves or at others whom they felt betrayed them) on the people they love and who love them the most their partners and children. The purpose of this book is to help you (and your veteran) better understand combat trauma and its possible effects on intimate relationships and family life and to guide you to resources that can help strengthen every member of your family. The beginning chapters provide basic information about combat trauma and how it can lead to depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other forms of emotional pain. The remaining chapters focus on some of the most common problems confronting families of combat veterans: emotional numbing, sexual difficulties, anger, and guilt. There are also chapters on family violence, children, women veterans, and military couples and sections on how to cope with anger and depression, how to find helpful organizations and books, and how to communicate effectively on difficult issues. In addition to describing the tensions that can result from combat trauma, this book emphasizes the many ways a veteran s war experiences can help enrich individual family members and the family as a whole. Just as one part of your family cannot suffer without that suf</p><p>Dr. Matsakis is an internationally recognized trauma specialist in areas such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders, clinical depression, and addiction and related issues and their impact on relationships and the family.

Emerson&#39;s Inferno delights on many levels: as an ingenious translation of classic verse; an effortlessly readable introduction to a complex poem; a delicious crib for anxious Dante students; and as a warm tribute from the master of one art form to the grand master of another. Hunt&#39;s cartoon is followed by Kevin Jackson&#39;s essay on Dante.

Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won&#x2019;t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins&#x2019;s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn&#x2019;t help but think: <i>Hitchcockian</i>. From the opening line, the reader knows what they&#x2019;re in for: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks...&#x201d; But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran&#x2019;s finesse. The &#x201c;girl on the train&#x201d; is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees &#x201c;Jess&#x201d; kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character&#x2019;s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel&#x2019;s ex-husband&#x2019;s wife, who happens to be Jess/Megan&#x2019;s neighbor. Rachel&#x2019;s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess/Megan&#x2019;s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn&#x2019;t. This is a book to be devoured. <i>-Neal Thompson</i></p><b>Paula Hawkins</b> worked as a journalist for fifteen years before turning her hand to fiction.

They avoid weaknesses identified in those of Euclid, whose works at the time were still used textbook-fashion. Hilbert&#39;s approach signaled the shift to the modern axiomatic method. Axioms are not taken as self-evident truths. Geometry may treat things, about which we have powerful intuitions, but it is not necessary to assign any explicit meaning to the undefined concepts. The elements, such as point, line, plane, and others, could be substituted, as Hilbert is reported to have said, by tables, chairs, glasses of beer and other such objects. It is their defined relationships that are discussed. Hilbert first enumerates the undefined concepts: point, line, plane, lying on (a relation between points and lines, points and planes, and lines and planes), betweenness, congruence of pairs of points (line segments), and congruence of angles. The axioms unify both the plane geometry and solid geometry of Euclid in a single system. Hilbert put forth a most influential list of 23 unsolved problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. This is generally reckoned the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.</p><p></p><h2>The Olmec World: A History of Mesoamerica</h2><p>According to Arnold Toynbee, a civilization arises in response to a challenge. In Central America - the Mesopotamia of the New World - the challenge was the jungle. The Olmecs were the first people to meet this challenge successfully. The coastal plain of Veracruz and Tabasco, along the southern curve of the Gulf of Mexico, is the birthplace of the first great civilization of the western hemisphere. Between the thirteenth and first centuries B.C., the Olmecs built ceremonial centers such as La Venta, with monumental pyramids, a spacious courtyard, a basalt-columned tomb, a offerings of stones, Celts, and jaguar mosaics. At La Venta also are four of the twelve colossal carved Olmec heads that have thus far been discovered. The Olmecs, then, were not only artists but engineers and scientists as well. It is not fully understood how they moved the great stones to the stoneless plain or how they made their jade carvings, which rival the finest of the Orient. They discovered the value of the zero and achieved the most complete system of calculating time conceived in America. Over the centuries the Olmecs penetrated into the Valley of Mexico, southward into Oaxaca and Chiapas and on into the highlands and Pacific coast of Guatemala. Monte Alban in the Valley of Oaxaca shows strong Olmec influence. Thus, this people not only engendered Mesoamerican civilization but also brought forth what might be called the first Mesoamerican empire. The Olmecs appear to have established the pattern which, through the centuries, was to be followed by later expansionist Mesoamerican cultures. The end of the Olmec world was not so much an end as a beginning. It led directly into the Classic world of Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, Tajin, and the Maya, peoples who received the Olmec inheritance and pushed civilization to far higher levels. In an engrossing reconstruction, Ignacio Bernal examines Olmec art, society, and religious beliefs.</p><p></p><h2>Seduced by Modernity: The Photography of Margaret Watkins</h2><p>Mary O&#39;Connor and Katherine Tweedie tell the story of a dedicated artist in difficult circumstances whose working life spanned a Victorian upbringing in Hamilton, Ontario, and the witnessing of the first Soviet Five-Year Plan. The authors use feminist and historical questions as well as close readings of the photographs to relate Watkins&#39; work to questions of gender, modernity, and visual culture. Watkins&#39; modernism, which involved experimentation and a radical focus on form, transgressed boundaries of conventional, high-art subject matter. Her focus was daily life and her photographs, whether an exploration of the objects in her New York kitchen or the public and industrial spaces of Glasgow, Paris, Cologne, Moscow, and Leningrad in the 1930s, strike a balance between abstraction and an evocation of the everyday, offering a unique gendered perspective on modernism and modernity.</p><p>Mary O'Connor is professor, English and cultural studies, McMaster University.<br>Katherine Tweedie is professor, studio arts, Concordia University.&#34;Seduced by Modernity is three things in one: a most remarkable, vivid biography of a fascinating person; an analysis of the oeuvre of an important artist-photographer; and an extremely successful study of the interrelations of twentieth century art, gender, and mass culture, interlaced superbly with supporting theoretical passages. This is an extraordinary accomplishment.&#34; Lora Carney, University of Toronto</p><h2>Why, Lord?: Suffering and Evil in Black Theology</h2><p><p>"By challenging some of the most cherished theological beliefs to emerge within black Christian communities, Pinn encourages us to extend the range of our religious world views and embrace black cultural expressions that have been ignored and despised ...

"That whole scene was like a flipped coin spinning in the air, one side ordinary, one side surreal."<br>&nbsp;<br>Like us then: five men and one woman perched on circled metal folding chairs.<br>&nbsp;<br>"There I was," said Russell, "walking another patrol in the Balkan slaughterhouse. Main Street buildings were smeared smoke black. Busted windows. Rubble littered the road. We tramped past a fire-bombed Toyota. Every step, something crunched under your boot. A laptop computer. A woman's purse. Three ropes dangled from a street lamp, but they were cut empty, so the rumors about a cleanup were probably true."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What isn't true?" said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Leon Friedman had brown hair. Emerald eyes inside gold metal glasses. As he had for each of the fourteen days he'd spent with us, he wore a tweed sports jacket. That last day, he had on a blue shirt, no tie.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Place like that," said Russell, "everything is true, nothing is true."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I see," said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No you don't," I said. "Not if you're lucky."<br>&nbsp;<br>"'Xactly," said Zane, who looked like an albino Jesus.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We're listening to Russell now," said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell was fronting his rock star look: midnight lens aviator shades, a black leather sports jacket over an indigo T-shirt emblazoned wilco for the band, not the military response he'd been taught. He wore blue jeans, retro black-and-white sneakers.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Make it late May 1992," said Russell. "We were jazzed to get somewhere safe."<br>&nbsp;<br>Hailey picked scabs into her ebony-skinned arm, mumbled: "No such place."<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell ignored her. "That once-was-Yugoslavia town smelled like gunpowder and burned wood. Rotten garbage and rats, man, I can still see badass rats with red eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The restaurant had cardboard over two windows but a sign that read open. When the Colonel swung the door in, a bell tinkled. He turns to us nine guys, says: 'We take turns.' Then he beckons me and his two favorite goons, a couple of thrill-kill boys Milosovic sprang from prison and made 'militia.' We go in. The place has a handful of customers, all true Serbs like us, and fuck everybody else."<br>&nbsp;<br>The white Styrofoam cup trembled as Russell raised it to his lips. "Where was I?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Friedman said: "You just said, 'Fuck everybody else.'"<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell swallowed more coffee. "I mean, where was I in my story?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ahh," said the therapist: "Your story. Of your spy mission."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Got it," said Russell. "The ma�tre d' glides through the restaurant like he's skating on ice. He's hairless. Pale as a bone. Milky eyes. Stone cold. Four werewolves in army fatigues with AK-47s walk in and ding his bell but he doesn't blink. He's wearing a black bow tie, a white shirt, blue jeans, a black tuxedo tails coat like Dracula. Plus, one hand ballerina waitress style, he's balancing an empty tray."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sounds like an LSD trip," said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Doc!" Russell grinned. "Who knew you're such a rebel!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I have an interesting father. What about you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Nah," said Russell, "Dad never did nothing that could get him in trouble. He never had to. And he isn't in the story--in the restaurant, that was just me, all me."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And who else?" asked Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I told you: Colonel Herzgl, the fat fuck. Smelled like garlic and vodka. They claim vodka doesn't smell, that's another lie. Believe me, it smells, and I . . . I . . ."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're in the restaurant," said Dr. F. "With Colonel Herzgl, his men."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And the ma�tre d'. Who glides up to us through the tables holding his empty tray, Nazi pin on his lapel, man, he lets us fall into his milk eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Colonel Herzgl glares at him, says: 'You got crap on for music.'<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tunes are coming from a boom box on the bar, and the Colonel is dead-on right: it's crap. Some accordion flute zither ethnic bullshit. Colonel Herzgl is an Elvis freak. He's carrying a torch for a bloated icon who bought it in a . . . ah . . . in a bathroom--"<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Friedman blinked. And I caught him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"--who bought it in a bathroom while Herzgl was still a Commie punk in Belgrade. Now he's got this one lousy tape, the soundtrack from Viva Las Vegas! Not the worst Elvis movie, not even his worst bunch of songs, but man: after the first forty times you hear it and get ordered to translate it and teach the Colonel to sing along . . . !<br>&nbsp;<br>"Colonel Herzgl gives the Elvis tape to the ma�tre d', who leads us to a table and on it is a bottle of that plum brandy. Rakija. No glasses. We sit, pass around the bottle."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Please say you didn't put your lips where theirs were!" said Hailey.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Shit, yes! You think I'd bust cover by playing the snob?" said Russell. "So the ma�tre d' says: 'Potato soup,' which is all this war zone caf� has, except for rakija. Off he goes. A few swigs later, and boom box Elvis blasts out 'Viva Las Vegas'!"<br>&nbsp;<br>The Ward Room door swung open, pushed inward by a rolling mirror metal box.<br>&nbsp;<br>The meds cart rolled across the sun-swept floor. I checked out the nurse driving it who, like Dr. F, had rotated in while the regular staff were on furlough.<br>&nbsp;<br>The substitute nurse was a pretty woman who'd walked miles of hospital corridors. She wore the uniform white slacks and top with a black cardigan sweater. Wore her brown hair pinned in a bun. She unlocked the meds cart, stacked tiny paper cups on the metal top, checked her clipboard.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Friedman said: "What did it smell like?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why do you want to know that?" said Russell.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We know what outside the caf� smelled like--gunpowder, burned wood, smoke, rubble. What did it smell like at that table?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What difference . . . There's that rakija plum brandy. Plus us four unshowered army fatigue guys. And kind of a salty smell. Potato soup from the kitchen, the--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What kind of salty smell?" asked Dr. Friedman. "Like . . . tears?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"'Like tears,' what the hell difference does that make, it's all about what I do. And now, with Elvis blasting 'Viva Las Vegas,' I finally got my chance to do."<br>&nbsp;<br>The nurse shook pills into a paper cup.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Friedman said: "You finally got your chance to do what?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"To kill Colonel Herzgl."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But that wasn't your mission. You weren't an assassin."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Don't you tell me who I wasn't!" yelled Russell. "I was who I was and I did it!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Friedman stared at the trained warrior. "Tell us about your official mission."<br>&nbsp;<br>"My official mission was, like, over, man! None of the factions--not the Moslems, not the Croats, for sure not those damn Serbs, none of them got squat from the caches Uncle Sam's bad boys had snuck into Yugoslavia during the Cold War. None of them had the missing suitcase nukes. Don't you think they'd have used them? They all wanted total annihilation, and there's no better way to go total than nuclear."<br>&nbsp;<br>"So why were you still there?" said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>"How could I leave?" Russell shrank on his chair. "That place went from skirmishes to slaughterhouse in a blink. What was going on outside that restaurant, what I'd had to see and play along with as the rock 'n' roll Serbian-American kid come back to find his roots and help his heroes . . . Over there, being crazy was the rule. If you weren't when it started . . . How do you think I ended up here?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You tell us."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I killed the Colonel."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Because I could. I couldn't stop anything big, but if I iced that one fat fuck monster who I'd latched onto when I still had a sane mission . . . Before I bugged out, I could put him down for . . . for all the horror he did. Was going to keep doing.<br>&nbsp;<br>"When Elvis kicked in with 'Viva Las Vegas,' Herzgl said, 'I not wait.' He tells me, 'You next,'&nbsp; and walks through the dining room to the bathroom."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Did he go alone?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What do you mean, 'Did he go alone'? Of course he went alone! What do you think, that we were a bunch of Kansas schoolgirls on prom night?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell shook his head. "They wouldn't listen to me. Didn't believe me. Phones worked. Not everywhere, but . . . I'd reported to my case officer in Prague. Hell, I called Langley direct! They insisted I was 'off mission.' Or 'overloaded.' I was to ex-filtrate stat. Good job. Mission over. Come home and . . . They wouldn't believe me."<br>&nbsp;<br>"That was only at first," said Dr. F. "Then satellite photos, other sources--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"'At first' is where you start. You gotta get to 'at last.'"<br>&nbsp;<br>"So you stayed."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I went into that bathroom." Russell blinked. "That was my chance.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I told the two goons fuck the Colonel, I had to go now. They laughed.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Nobody looked at me as I walked through the dining room. The bathroom was through a set of swinging doors, down a hall. The bulb in that hall was burned out, so it was a long dark tunnel. Stank. Urine, rats, rakija--I know you want to know how it smells, Doc, no need to thank me."<br>&nbsp;<br>But Friedman said nothing to interrupt. He sensed the roll. Knew it was coming.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I put my right hand in my fatigue jacket pocket," said Russell. "My knife and AK-47 were back at the table, but two days before, the day they burned up the schoolhouse full of kids, I found a steel wire about a yard long, stuck it in my pocket. Figured I could rig a grenade trip to get the Colonel and his whole squad. But that was me being optimistic, not practical. Walking to the bathroom, I was the zen of practical.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I had one end of the wire cinched around my right grip before I hit the swinging doors. Ten steps down that long dark tunnel to the closed men's room door, Viva Las Vegas, and by the time I get there, the other end is cinched around my left grip.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Two ways to go in for a whack," Russell told us. "Blitz or sly--sly ninja or sly bold like Skorzeny, march in banners flying.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I've always been a Skorzeny man. I burst into the bathroom singing Elvis over the tape of Elvis, and Herzgl, why he loved it. He was at the mirror. The stall with . . . The stall with, um . . . He was boogying with his back to me as I sang and then wham!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell twisted in his seat as he pantomimed flipping the wire loop around the Colonel's neck from behind and garroting the trashing Colonel.<br>&nbsp;<br>"He was tough and it was hard. For you, Doc, I could smell his garlic and sweat. The flesh on his neck burned like acid on my hands."<br>&nbsp;<br>Whoa! I thought:"The flesh . . . burned like acid." That was a new detail. A key sensory memory. Bravo Dr. Friedman! In two weeks, you'd moved Russell off the same-old-same-old to the reveal of a touch of flesh.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of course I left the wire," said Russell. "Walked out to find out I'd fucked up."<br>&nbsp;<br>"How?" said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The fire exit was locked! Nowhere to go but back to those two Serb militia pricks--who, luckily for me, had pulled the big joke and eaten my bowl of potato soup."<br>&nbsp;<br>Nurse coughed: "Time for their meds."<br>&nbsp;<br>Fuck her, I thought. Maybe Russell is on the edge of a breakthrough.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. F's negative wave to the nurse agreed with me.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I asked: "Did anybody say anything when you came out of the bathroom?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Giving Russell a chance to bust the lie himself. To see it himself.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah. They all laughed at me 'cause I wasn't going to eat."<br>&nbsp;<br>White-haired Zane picked up on my riff: "What did they say about you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>But Russell just shrugged. "They said, 'Tough luck, American!' Them eating my soup gave me an excuse to get pissed off, grab my gear, and storm out of the restaurant. I got outside, marched right through the other six guys, turned the corner--and ran like hell for three days. Rode a black ops Navy carrier chopper out. Told the Agency what I did, and now here I am."<br>&nbsp;<br>Zane looked at me. We could have busted Russell. But that was Friedman's job. Besides, if you don't bust somebody else's lies, maybe nobody will bust yours.<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell said: "The funny thing is, I don't feel anything about killing him. Just . . . nothing. Of course, I won't listen to Elvis anymore. I guess that's why I'm here."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't think so," said Dr. Friedman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Russell arched his eyebrows above the black lenses of his sunglasses. Grinned. "Doesn't really matter what you think, now does it, Doc? You're leaving us."<br>&nbsp;<br>Nurse said: "Dr. Friedman? Our schedule."<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded. She passed out water cups and our meds like candy for the movie: uppers, downers, smoother-outers, sugar pills in Hailey's cup, a rainbow of pebbles geared to Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome with icings of schizophrenic disorders.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We've got one last Group this afternoon," said Dr. Friedman. "I'll see some of you individually before then, but I'm leaving here before dinner."<br>&nbsp;<br>Eric raised his hand to blurt out that it was meatloaf night, but didn't get the nod.<br>&nbsp;<br>"There's something we need to talk about this afternoon," continued Dr. Friedman, "and we should all look forward to that. Have a nice lunch."<br>&nbsp;<br>He smiled as he left the Ward. The nurse collected our empty pill cups. I watched her thick brown hair in its pinned bun, watched her round hips in white slacks as she pushed the cart out of our Ward. Russell and Zane, even Hailey and Eric watched her: the substitute nurse was new and thus interesting, though she'd kept a professional distance from us. Then the Ward door closed. Locked. We drifted to our private rooms not knowing that we had less than five hours of safe time left before.<br>&nbsp;<br>We should have known.<br>&nbsp;<br>The tell was there for us to see.<br>&nbsp;<br>We had the training. The experience. But we missed it, each and every one of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>What the hell.

Written by what one might now describe as a Victorian Martha Stewart, the book offers advice on fashion, child-care, animal husbandry, poisons, and the management of servants. To the modern reader expecting stuffy verbosity or heavy moralizing, Beeton's book is a revelation: it explores the foods of Europe and beyond, suggesting new food stuffs and techniques, mixing domestic advice with discussions of science, religion, class, industrialism and gender roles. Alternately frugal and fashionable, anxious and self confident, the book highlights the concerns of the growing Victorian middle-class at a key moment in its history. This abridged edition serves as a cookery book, while documenting a significant aspect of Victorian social and cultural history.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The news that brings her back is that her companion and friend, the Saxon monk Brother Eadulf, is under arrest for a serious crime in the neighboring kingdom of Laigin. Riding furiously through hostile territory, she arrives only to find out she is too late. Eadulf has already been tried and found guilty of the murder of a young girl. Even worse, Laigin's king has abandoned the traditional judicial code of Ireland in favor of the ecclesiastical Penitential from Rome-and under this code he is to be executed the following morning.<br><br> Convinced that her friend is innocent, Fidelma has only twenty-four hours before his execution to come up with evidence persuasive enough to sway the king into allowing an appeal of Eadulf's conviction. Facing a king determined to make an example of Eadulf and an old adversary of her own, Fidelma soon realizes that nothing is as it was portrayed, and behind the heinous crime is an even more shocking conspiracy. Now, Fidelma must unravel her most perplexing puzzle before time runs out for her closest companion.<br></p><p>Peter Tremayne is the fiction pseudonym for Peter Berresford Ellis, a prominent author on the ancient Celts and author of numbers works of history and scholarship.

He lives in London<br>&nbsp; Our Lady of Darkness<br>Chapter OneThe horses cantered along the dusk-shrouded mountain road. There were four of them, snorting and blowing as their riders urged them forward. The travellers consisted of three men and a woman. The men wore the garments and weaponry of warriors but the woman was distinguished from her companions not only by her sex but by the fact that she was clad in the robes of a religieuse. While the evening gloom cloaked their individual features, it was clear from the state of their mounts and the fatigued attitude with which they rode them that the four had journeyed many a kilometre that day.&#x2018;Are you sure that this is the right road?&#x2019; called the woman, casting an anxious glance around at the entangling woods through which they were rapidly descending. The track across the mountain dipped steeper into the valley. Below them, just discernible in the fading light, was a broad glen with a sizable river snaking through it.The young, dust-covered warrior who rode at her side spoke out.&#x2018;I have ridden many times as a courier from Cashel to Fearna, lady, and I know this route well. A kilometre or so ahead we will come to a place where another river flows from the west to join the river you see below us. There, by the joining of the rivers, is Morca&#x2019;s inn where we may spend the night.&#x2019;&#x2018;But every hour counts, Dego,&#x2019; replied the woman. &#x2018;Can&#x2019;t we press on to Fearna tonight?&#x2019;The warrior hesitated before replying, doubtless wondering how to make himself firm but phrasing his words with respect.&#x2018;Lady, I promised your brother, the King, that I and my companions would keep you safe on this journey. I would not advise travelling in this countryside at night. There are many dangers in this area for the likes of us. If we stay at the inn and make an early start in the morning, we will be at the castle of the King of Laigin well before noon tomorrow. And we will arrive refreshed after a night&#x2019;s rest, rather than tired and weary from riding through the night.&#x2019;The tall religieuse was silent and the warrior called Dego took her silence as an acceptance of his advice.Dego was a member of the warrior guard of Colg�, King of Muman; it had been the King himself who had summoned him with an order to escort his sister, Fidelma of Cashel, to Fearna, the capital of the Kingdom of Laigin, whose lands bordered Colg�&#x2019;s kingdom. There had been little reason to ask why Fidelma was making this journey, for the news had been freely bruited about the great palace of Cashel.Fidelma had arrived home from a pilgrim voyage to the Tomb of St James, her journey hastened by the news that Brother Eadulf, the Saxon emissary to Cashel from Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury, had been accused of murder. The details were as yet unclear but, so the gossip had it, Brother Eadulf had been returning to Canterbury, which lay in the land of the Saxons to the east when, passing through the kingdom of Laigin, he had been captured and accused of killing someone. There were no other details.What was well known among the people of Cashel was that, during the past year, Brother Eadulf not only had become a friend of King Colg� but a close companion of his sister, Fidelma. The talk had it that Fidelma had determined to journey to Laigin in order to take up the defence of her friend, for she was not merely a religieuse but a <i>d�laigh,</i> an advocate, of the law courts of the five kingdoms.Gossip or not, Dego knew that Fidelma had landed from the pilgrim ship at Ardmore, ridden hard for Cashel and spent barely an hour or so with her brother, before setting off for Fearna, Laigin&#x2019;s capital, where Eadulf was being held. In fact, Dego and his companions were hard pressed to keep up with the grim-faced Fidelma who seemed to be able to ride better than any of them.Dego was nervous as he glanced at her now. There was a glint in her blue-green eyes which boded ill for anyone who would contradict her will. He was certain that his recommendation was the best course of action, but he was also anxious that Fidelma understood his reasons for suggesting it. He knew well enough that she was anxious to reach the Laigin capital as soon as possible.&#x2018;There is enmity between Cashel and Fearna, lady,&#x2019; he ventured, after some thought. &#x2018;There is still war along the border of Osraige. Should we fall in with wandering bands of Laigin warriors, they might not respect the protection of your office.&#x2019;Fidelma&#x2019;s stern features softened momentarily.&#x2018;I am aware of the situation, Dego. You are wise in your advice.&#x2019;She said no more. Dego opened his mouth to speak again but another glance at her made him realise that to say anything else would merely be superfluous and might annoy her.After all, there was none better qualified than Fidelma to know the position of the dispute between Cashel and Fearna. She had clashed with the excitable young King Fianamail of Laigin before. Fianamail was certainly no friend of Cashel and, in particular, he now nursed a grudge against Fidelma.Young Dego, knowing this, admired his lady&#x2019;s courage for riding immediately to the aid of her Saxon friend, straight into the enemy&#x2019;s lands. Only the fact that she was a <i>d�laigh</i> of the courts allowed her to move so freely, without let or hindrance. No person in the five kingdoms would dare lay hands on her for they would face a terrible retribution; the loss of their honour price, to be outcast forever from society, without the law to protect them. No lawful person would knowingly lay hands on a <i>d�laigh</i> of the courts, especially one such as Fidelma who had been honoured by the High King, Sechnassach, himself. The mantle of a <i>d�laigh</i> of the courts was a greater protection than being either sister to the King of Muman or, indeed, being a religieuse of the Faith of Christ.However, it was not those who subscribed to the law that Dego was worried about. He knew the minds of King Fianamail and his advisers could be dark and deep. It would be so easy to have Fidelma killed and swear it was done by a wandering band of outlaws. That was why Colg� had sought out his three best warriors and asked them to accompany his sister to Laigin. He did not order them to go for they would be in as much danger as she was, although he did present each with a wand of office indicating that they acted as his emissaries under the protection of the laws of an embassy. It was the maximum that was in his power to give them as legal protection.Dego, and his companions, Enda and Aidan, riding behind with eyes constantly alert for danger, had no hesitation in accepting the charge laid on them, in spite of their misgivings about the trustworthiness of the King of Laigin. Where Fidelma went, they would willingly follow, for the people of Cashel reserved a special place of affection for the tall, red-haired young sister of their King.&#x2018;The inn is just ahead,&#x2019; called Enda from behind.Dego screwed up his eyes to penetrate the gloom.He could see a lantern swinging from its pole, the traditional method by which innkeepers announced the presence of their establishments &#x2013; to literally light the way for weary travellers. Dego halted his horse before the group of buildings. A couple of stable boys ran forward from the shadows to take their mounts and hold them while the riders undid their saddlebags and moved towards the tavern doors.A broad-shouldered, elderly man opened the doors, letting a shaft of light fall across them as they approached the wooden steps on which he stood.&#x2018;Warriors from Muman!&#x2019; The man frowned, as his eyes wandered over them, taking in their manner of clothing and weapons. The tone of his voice was not welcoming. &#x2018;We do not often see your kind in this land these days. Do you come in peace?&#x2019;Dego halted on the step below him and scowled. &#x2018;We come seeking your hospitality, Morca. Do you refuse to grant it?&#x2019;The ponderous innkeeper stared at him for a moment, trying to recognise him in the shadowy light.&#x2018;You know my name, warrior. How so?&#x2019;&#x2018;I have often stayed here before. We are an embassy from the King of Cashel to the King of Laigin. I say again, do you refuse us hospitality?&#x2019;The innkeeper shrugged indifferently.&#x2018;It is not my place to refuse, especially if the company is so eminent as emissaries from the King of Cashel to my own King. If you seek the hospitality of this inn then you shall have it. Your silver is doubtless as good as any other&#x2019;s.&#x2019;He turned ungraciously, without a further word, and went back into the main room of the inn.This large room had a fire burning in the hearth at one end. There were several tables at which people sat in various stages of eating and drinking. There was an old man at one end who was strumming a <i>cruit,</i> a small U-shaped harp. No one seemed to be paying any attention to his aimless wandering over the strings. Some of those present were obviously locals who had come to be sociable and drink with their neighbours while others were travellers enjoying an early evening meal. The whisper of &#x2018;warriors of Muman&#x2019; had spread rapidly through the room and the assembly fell silent as they entered. Even the harpist hesitated and his fingers became still.Dego glanced nervously around, hand resting lightly on the hilt of his sword.&#x2018;Do you see what I mean, lady?&#x2019; he whispered to Fidelma. &#x2018;There is antagonism here and we must be wary.&#x2019;Fidelma gave him a swift smile of reassurance and led the way to an unoccupied table, setting down her saddle bag before seating herself. Dego, Enda and Aidan followed her example, yet the eyes of the warriors were not still. The score or so of other people remained quiet, watching them surreptitiously. The innkeeper had removed himself to the far side of the room, deliberately ignoring his new guests.&#x2018;Innkeeper!&#x2019; Fidelma&#x2019;s voice cut sharply across the room.Reluctantly, the burly man came across to them in the icy silence.&#x2018;You seem unwilling to perform your duties under the law.&#x2019;The man called Morca was obviously not expecting her belligerent comment. He recovered from his surprise and glowered at her.&#x2018;What does a religieuse know of the laws of innkeepers?&#x2019; he sneered.Fidelma returned his taunt with an even voice. &#x2018;I am a <i>d�laigh,</i> qualified to the level of <i>anruth.</i> Does that answer your question?&#x2019;The atmosphere seemed to grow even colder.Dego&#x2019;s hand brushed against the hilt of his sword again; his muscles tensed.Fidelma held the innkeeper&#x2019;s eyes in her own fiery green orbs like a snake ensnaring a rabbit. The man seemed transfixed. Her voice remained soft and mesmeric.&#x2018;You are obliged to provide us with your services and to do it with good grace. If you do not, you will be deemed guilty of <i>etech;</i> that is refusal to fulfil the obligation placed on you by law. You would then have to pay to each and every one of us the sum of our honour price. If it is deemed that you acted in knowledge and malice towards us, then you could also lose the <i>dire</i> of this inn; it could be destroyed and no compensation need be given you. Do I make the law clear to you, innkeeper?&#x2019;The man stood staring at her as if trying to summon his lost voice. Finally, he dropped his eyes from her fiery gaze, shuffled his feet and nodded.&#x2018;I meant no disrespect. The times ... the times are difficult.&#x2019;&#x2018;Times may be difficult but the law is the law and you must obey it,&#x2019; she replied. &#x2018;Now, my companions and I want beds for the night and we also want a meal &#x2013; immediately.&#x2019;The man bobbed his head once again, his stance changed to one of anxiety to be of service.&#x2018;It shall be provided at once, Sister. At once.&#x2019;He turned, calling for his wife and, as he did so, it seemed to be a signal for the silence to cease and the noise of conversation began again. The plaintive notes of the harp recommenced.Dego sat back, relaxing with a wan smile.&#x2018;The Laigin certainly have no liking for us, lady.&#x2019;Fidelma sighed softly. &#x2018;They are, unfortunately, led, thinking they must obey the prejudices of their young King. However, the law must stand above all.&#x2019;The innkeeper&#x2019;s wife came forward with a smile that seemed slightly artificial. She brought them bowls of stew from a cauldron that had been simmering over the fire. Mead and bread were also provided.For a while, the four visitors concentrated on their meal, having ridden hard that day and not having paused for a midday repast. It was only after they had eaten their fill and were relaxing with their earthenware mugs of mead that Fidelma began to take more notice of her immediate surroundings and of the other guests in the inn.The other travellers consisted of a couple of religieux in brown homespun and a small group of merchants. In addition to these were the locals, mostly farmers, and there was a blacksmith enjoying a drink and a chat. Seated at the next table were two farmers engaged in conversation. It was some time before Fidelma realised that their conversation was not the usual farmers&#x2019; discourse. She frowned, turning herself slightly to listen more attentively.&#x2018;It is right to make an example of the man. The Saxon stranger merits all he gets,&#x2019; one of them was saying.&#x2018;The Saxons have always been a plague to this land, raiding and plundering our ships and coastal settlements,&#x2019; the other agreed. &#x2018;Pirates they are and we have been too lenient with them for long enough. A war against the Saxons would bring better profits to Fianamail than a war with Muman.&#x2019;One of the farmers suddenly saw that he had caught Fidelma&#x2019;s attention. He became embarrassed, coughed and stood up.&#x2018;Well, I must be to my bed. I am ploughing the lower field tomorrow.&#x2019; He turned and strode from the inn, bidding the innkeeper and his wife a good night.Fidelma swung round on his companion. He was a younger man and she realised from his garb that he was a shepherd. Oblivious to the reason for his companion&#x2019;s hurried departure, he was finishing his mead.Fidelma greeted him with a friendly nod.&#x2018;I overheard you speaking of Saxons,&#x2019; she began brightly. &#x2018;Are you having problems with Saxon raiders in this land?&#x2019;The shepherd looked nervous at being addressed by a religieuse.&#x2018;The coastal ports of the South-East have suffered many raids by Saxon pirates, Sister,&#x2019; he conceded gruffly. &#x2018;I have heard that three trading vessels, one from Gaul, were attacked and sunk off Cahore Point, after being robbed, only a week ago.&#x2019;&#x2018;Did I understand from your conversation with your friend that one such pirate has been caught?&#x2019;The man frowned, as if to recollect the conversation, and then shook his head. &#x2018;Not a pirate exactly. The talk is of a Saxon who murdered a religieuse.&#x2019;Fidelma leaned backwards trying not to show the shock on her features. The murder of a religieuse! Surely this was not her Eadulf whom the man was talking about? It was nine days since the news had caught up with her at the coastal port in Iberia. That meant that the crime with which Eadulf had been charged was at least three weeks old. The one thing that concerned Fidelma was that events might have moved rapidly on and she would arrive too late to defend him, even though her brother had sent a message to Fianamail requesting a delay in the proceedings. However, the idea that Eadulf could possibly be involved in the murd...</p><h2>Life of Saint Paul, The</h2><p><p>This volume is fittingly a part of James Stalker's trilogy The Life of Jesus Christ, The Trial and Death of Jesus Christ, and The life of St. Paul, for the apostle Paul is the interpreter of the entire purpose of Christ's coming.

Young Benny has never met a burger he didn't like; in fact, he will eat nothing else. After a steady diet of beef patties on a bun, he becomes one and finds himself being chased across the countryside by a pack of dogs, a herd of cows, and a group of hungry boys. He is finally saved from being a sideshow attraction at a burger franchise by his wise mother, who plies him with fruits and vegetables. The story is saved from a didactic and predictable ending by the warning that Benny should take care not to eat just vegetables, lest he finds himself transformed again. The simple lines and lively colors of the acrylic and colored-pencil illustrations add to the kid appeal.

The faint possibility of failure had always been at the back of her mind, but now that her ship had actually delivered her to the Congressional capital world, now that she had actually frameshifted to New Far Florence across all those dizzying light-years, the faint possibility had sharpened into a stomach-churning conviction that she was about to suffer imminent and chastening defeat. There had always been people eager to tell her that her proposal was doomed, but for the first time it occurred to her that they could be right. What she had in mind was, even by her own admission, a deeply unorthodox suggestion.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s certainly a nice day for it,&#x201d; said Rudd Indigo Mammatus, joining her on the balcony, high above the cloud-girdled tiers and gardens of the Congress building&#x2019;s footslopes.</p><p>&#x201c;Abject humiliation, you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>Rudd shook his head good-naturedly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the last perfect day of summer. I&#x2019;ve checked: tomorrow will be cooler, stormier. Doesn&#x2019;t that strike you as suitably auspicious?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried. I think I&#x2019;m going to make an idiot of myself in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all made idiots of ourselves at some point. In this line of work it&#x2019;s almost obligatory.&#x201d;</p><p>Chromis and Rudd were politicians, political friends from different constituencies of the Congress of the Lindblad Ring. Chromis spoke for a relatively small grouping of settled worlds: a mere one hundred and thirty planet-class entities, packed into a volume of space only twenty light-years across. Rudd&#x2019;s constituency, located on the edge of the Ring&#x2014;where it brushed against the fractious outer worlds of the Loop II Imperium&#x2014;enveloped a much larger volume of space but only a third as many planet-class entities. Politically, they had very little in common, but by the same token they had very little worth squabbling over. Once every five hundred years, when the representatives were summoned to New Far Florence, Chromis and Rudd would meet to swap world-weary tales of scandal and chicanery from their respective constituencies.</p><p>Chromis fingered the ring on her right index finger, tracing the interlocking, hypnotically complex design embossed into its surface. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll go for it? It&#x2019;s been eighteen thousand years, after all. It&#x2019;s asking a lot of people to think back that far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The whole point of this little exercise is to dream up something to commemorate ten thousand years of our glorious Congress,&#x201d; Rudd said, with only the slightest trace of irony. &#x201c;If the other representatives can&#x2019;t get off their fat backsides and think back another eight thousand years before that, they deserve to have the reeves set on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t joke,&#x201d; Chromis said darkly. &#x201c;I heard they had to send in the reeves on Hemlock only four hundred years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Messy business, too: by all accounts there were at least a dozen non-recoverable dead. But I wasn&#x2019;t joking, Chromis: if they don&#x2019;t bite, I&#x2019;ll personally recommend a police action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If only everyone else felt the same way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then damn well go in there and see to it that they do.&#x201d; Rudd offered his hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time, anyway. The last thing you want to do is keep any of them waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>She took his hand chastely. Rudd was an attractive man, and Chromis had it on good authority that she had many admirers in the Congress, but their friendship was strictly platonic: they both had partners back on their home-worlds, held in stasis cauls until they returned from New Far Florence. Chromis loved her husband, although many days might pass between thoughts of him. Without his help convincing one hundred and thirty worlds that this was something they had to support, the memorial plan would have stalled long ago.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really worried, Rudd. Worried I&#x2019;m about to screw up nearly a thousand years of preparation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your nerve and stick to the script,&#x201d; Rudd said sternly. &#x201c;No last-minute clever ideas, all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same goes for you. Remember: &#x2018;intended recipient&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudd smiled reassuringly and led her into the stratospheric vastness of the meeting room. The chamber had been constructed in the early centuries of the Congress, when it had aspirations to expand into territory now occupied by neighbouring polities. Space not being at a premium on New Far Florence, the hundred-odd representatives were scattered across nearly a square kilometre of gently sloping floor space, and the ceiling was ten kilometres above their heads. Slowly rotating in the middle of the room, lacking any material suspension, was the display cube in which their enlarged images would appear when they had the floor. While it waited for the session to begin, the cube projected the ancient emblem of the Congress: a three-dimensional rendering of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s drawing of a naked man encompassed within a square and circle, his limbs drawn twice so that he stood upon, and touched, both shapes.</p><p>Chromis and Rudd took their positions on either side of the floor. The last few delegates were arriving by transit caul: black humanoid shells popped into existence in the chamber before dissipating to reveal the occupants within. The femtomachinery of the cauls merged seamlessly with the local machinery of the Congress building. Every artificial object in the Congress of the Lindblad Ring&#x2014;from the largest frameshift liner to the smallest medical robot&#x2014;comprised countless copies of the same universal femtomachine element.</p><p>Routine business consumed the first hour of the meeting. Chromis sat patiently, shuffling mental permutations, wondering whether she should consider a change of approach. It was difficult to judge the mood of the gathering. But Rudd&#x2019;s advice had been sound. She held her nerve, and when she had the floor she spoke the words she had already committed to memory before leaving home.</p><p>&#x201c;Honoured delegates,&#x201d; she began, as her magnified image appeared in the display cube, &#x201c;we are nearing the ten thousandth year since the founding of our first colony&#x2014;the beginning of what we now recognise as the Congress of the Lindblad Ring. I believe we are all of a mind in one respect: something must be done to acknowledge this coming milestone, something that will reflect well upon our administration, especially in light of the similar anniversaries that have recently been celebrated in two of our neighbouring polities. There have been many suggestions as to how we might mark this occasion. A civic project, perhaps, such as a well-deserved terraforming or a timely stellar rejuvenation. A Dyson englobement&#x2014;purely for the hell of it&#x2014;or the frame-shifting of an entire world from one system to another. Even something as modest as the erection of a ceremonial dome or an ornamental fountain.&#x201d; Chromis paused and looked pointedly at the delegates who had proposed these latter projects, hoping that they felt suitably abashed at their dismal lack of vision.</p><p>&#x201c;There have been many excellent proposals, and doubtless there will be many more, but I wish to suggest something of an entirely different magnitude. Rather than creating something for ourselves, a monument in our own galactic backyard, I humbly suggest that we consider something altogether more altruistic. I propose an audacious act of cosmic gratitude: the sending of a message, a gift, across space and time. The intended recipient of this gift will be the person&#x2014;or the descendants of the person&#x2014;without whom the very fabric of our society would look unrecognisably different.&#x201d;</p><p>Chromis paused again, still unable to judge the mood of the delegates, the blank faces of those close enough to see conveying neither approval nor disapproval. She took a deep breath and pressed on. &#x201c;Doubtless we would have achieved some of the same advances eventually&#x2014;but who is to say that it wouldn&#x2019;t have taken tens of thousands of years rather than the mere handful of millennia it actually took? Instead of a mosaic of polities spread across nearly twelve thousand light-years of the galactic disc, we might very well be confined to a handful of systems, with all the risks that such close confinement would inevitably entail. And let us not forget that the insights that have allowed us to leapfrog centuries of slow development were given to us freely, with no expectation of reward. Our Benefactor sent that data back to Earth because it was the right thing to do.&#x201d; Here Chromis swallowed, uncomfortably aware that some might be thinking&#x2014;not without cause&#x2014;that the very same data had almost wiped out humanity as it struggled to assimilate dangerous new knowledge. But at a remove of eighteen thousand years, such thoughts were surely churlish. Fire had singed more than a few fingers before people learned how to use it.</p><p>She heard a few unconvinced grumbles, but no one chose to interrupt her. Chromis steeled herself and continued, &#x201c;I know that some of us have forgotten the precise nature of that act of charity. In a moment, I hope to jog our collective memory. But first let me outline exactly what I have in mind.&#x201d;</p><p>She craned her neck to look at the display cube. On cue, her image was replaced by a simulation of the galaxy, as if viewed from far outside: ancient and huge, littered with the humbling relics of the Spicans but empty of life&#x2014;so far as anyone knew&#x2014;save for the smudge of human presence spreading out from one spiral arm, like an inkblot.</p><p>&#x201c;The Benefactor and her people are still out there somewhere,&#x201d; Chromis said, &#x201c;almost certainly beyond the Hard Data Frontier&#x2014;perhaps even outside the galaxy itself. But unless the universe has more tricks up its sleeve than we suspect, they can&#x2019;t be more than eighteen thousand light-years away, even if they&#x2019;re still moving away from us. And perhaps they&#x2019;ve already arrived wherever...</p></p><h2>Hollywood Splash</h2><p>Integral to the image of Southern California glamour and success, the luxurious backyard pool symbolizes fun in the sun for those who have made it&#x2014;vivid, aqueous proof of the American Dream hard at play. As much of an icon of prosperity as it is a decadent trophy for healthful living and social aspirations, the pool is one of America&#x2019;s supreme status symbols dating back to the time of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. More than an athletic accoutrement, the swimming pool is superbly designed for socializing, frolicking, sunbathing, skinny dipping...in short, for having loud, splashy fun. <br><br> In <b><i>Hollywood Splash</i></b>, famed photographer V�ronique Vial, author of the blockbuster bestseller <i>Women Before 10 A.M.</i>, takes a dip into the private pools of today&#x2019;s top actors and models, and captures exclusive wet poses and staged aquatic antics from hundreds of famous and soon-to-be-famous stars, celebrities, and notable faces, featuring amusing and hilarious collaborative wet hijinks with Claudia Schiffer, Lisa Marie, Rosanna Arquette, Rachael Leigh Cook, Troy Garity, Julie Delpy, Shiva Rose, Dave Navarro and Carmen Electra, Norman Reedus, Erika Christensen, Tara Reid, Rachel Hunter, Brett Ratner, Daryl Hannah, Andy Garcia, Molly Sims, Heidi Klum, Djimon Hounsou, Michael York, Benjamin Bratt, Corey Feldman, Robin Tunney, Johnny Depp, Brooke Shields, Anastasia, Tatjana Patitz, Angie Everhart, Blair Underwood, Jeff Goldblum, Tia Carrere, Michael Chiklis, Diane Warren, Will Estes, Claire Forlani, Craig Kilborn, Neil Patrick Harris, Traci Bingham, Griffin Dunne, Gabriela Reece, Jennifer Grey, Seth Green, James Franco, Esai Morales, Lucy Lawless, Patrick Dempsey, Jenny Garth, William H.

An exclusive backstage photographer for the famed Cirque du Soleil and recipient of a World Press Award, Vial has exhibited her work at the prestigious Visa Pour l&#39;Image in Perpignan and at the renowned Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles. Vial is the author of numerous photo books including Women Before 10 A.M., Men Before 10 A.M. Too, and &#34;O&#34;: Cirque du Soleil at Bellagio, all from powerHouse Books. Vial lives in Los Angeles, California.In the ultimate gimmicky photography book, French-born photographer Vial (Women Before 10 A.M.) captures two quintessentially Hollywood images: movie stars and swimming pools. Most of the full-color photos feature those two images, although some deviate, showing stars urinating or canoeing on a lake, or non-stars (like the U.S. Synchronized Swimming Team) flaunting their stuff. Vial's images tend toward the sexy (there's Rosanna Arquette pouring a pitcher of water over her black lingerie-clad body, and loads of other shots feature wet t-shirts); some show stars skinny-dipping. Many reveal celebrities mid-air, about to take the plunge. The settings-often subjects' backyards-contribute to the book's insider feel, and there's something pleasantly unpolished about the image of Sasha Lazard (Dark Harbor) hiding her head between her arms as she dives in to a dark pool in a turquoise dress, or of Tom Cruise grinning euphorically just before he lands in a glimmering rectangle of water. No captions accompany the photos; readers must refer to a listing at the book's end to figure out who's who. 232 color photos. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eileen Gray</h2><p>One of the pioneers of modern design, Eileen Gray spent nearly seventy years of her long and creative life in Paris.

But movies took you out of yourself, made you belong to something, a quasi-religious experience if you like. Which is why, today, whenever I go to the cinema, I spend the first minutes of every movie worrying in case the audience is going to talk all the way through it. This book has something to do with all that but it really exists for one reason only &#x2013; to increase your enjoyment of the movies. If you want a thoroughly exhaustive reference work, put this back on the shelf now. If you want a film buff&#x2019;s guide to cinema as an art form, sorry. Or if you want a list of the cast and crew on every film, best go elsewhere, there are certain websites we&#x2019;d recommend. But if you want several hundred socking good reasons to visit your local rep house, watch a late-night rarity on! TV or splash out on that DVD movie you&#x2019;ve been promising yourself, you&#x2019;ll find them in here. There are no dull films in this book. Mad films, yes. Great films, certainly. Films that provoke fierce disputes as to whether they&#x2019;re well cool or, well, crap: you bet. So if your ambition is to spend even more of your life watching films than you already do, this should serve you well. Now go. Use it wisely. And may the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end at least once.

Yet Whitman and his work have been misrepresented by scholars and critics during the 20th century, and it is only recently that they have begun admitting the poet's homosexuality and examining its effect on his work. Gary Schmidgall's bold and well-researched <i>Walt Whitman: A Gay Life</i> presents abundant and irrefutable evidence of the poet's vibrant sexuality and details Whitman's sexual and romantic affairs. More important, however, he explains how Whitman's attraction to men was at the root of his poetic vision: in Whitman's work the "body electric" is more than a metaphor. <i>Walt Whitman: A Gay Life</i> is a vital addition to Whitman studies and critical work on American literature.<b>Gary Schmidgall</b> is the author of <b>The Stranger Wilde: Interpreting Oscar</b>, which <b>The Boston Globe</b> called ?An astute study?genuinely original," and <b>The San Francisco Chronicle</b> noted "Breathes new life into the memory of Wilde.?

Fast delivery through DHL/FedEx express.</p><p>Verticality, architectural and social, is the lofty idea at the heart of Colson Whitehead's odd, sly, and ultimately irresistible first novel. The setting is an unnamed though obviously New Yorkish high-rise city, the time less convincingly future than deliciously other, as it combines 21st-century engineering feats with 19th-century pork-barrel politics and smoky working-class pubs. Elevators are the technological expression of the vertical idea, and Lila Mae Watson, the city's first black female elevator inspector, is its embattled token of upward mobility. <p> Lila Mae's good ol' boy colleagues in the Department of Elevator Inspectors are understandably jealous of the flawless record that her natural intelligence and diligence have earned, and understandably delighted when Number Eleven in the newly completed Fanny Briggs Memorial Building goes into deadly free fall just hours after Lila Mae has signed off on it, using the controversial "Intuitionist" method of ascertaining elevator safety. It is, after all, an election year in the Elevator Guild, and the Empiricists would do most anything to discredit the Intuitionist faction. Everyone on both sides assumes that Number Eleven was sabotaged and Lila Mae set up to take the fall. "So complete is Number Eleven's ruin," writes Whitehead, "that there's nothing left but the sound of the crash, rising in the shaft, a fall in opposite: a soul." Lila Mae's doom seems equally irreversible.</p><p> Whitehead evokes a world so utterly involving to its own denizens that outside reality does not impinge on its perfect solipsism. We the readers are taken hostage as Lila Mae strives to exonerate herself in this urgent adventure full of government spies, underworld hit men, and seductive double agents. Behind the action, always, is the Idea. Lila Mae's quest reveals the existence of heretofore lost writings by James Fulton, father of Intuitionism, a giant of vertical thought, whose fate is mysteriously entwined with her own. If she is able to find and reveal his plan for the Black Box, the perfect, next-generation elevator, the city as it now exists will instantly be obsolescent. The social and economic implications are huge and the denouement is elegantly philosophical. Most impressive of all is the integrity of Whitehead's prose. Eschewing mere cleverness, resisting showoff word play, he somehow manages to strike a tone that's always funny, always fierce, <i>and</i> always entirely respectful of his characters and their world.

The result is one of the greatest diaries in the English language.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abridged and edited by Anne Olivier Bell, the wife of Virginia Woolf's nephew Quentin Bell.</p><p>VIRGINIA WOOLF was born in London in 1882, the daughter of Sir Leslie Stephen, first editor of <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i>. After his death in 1904 Virginia and her sister, the painter Vanessa Bell, moved to Bloomsbury and became the centre of 'The Bloomsbury Group'. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. <br><br>In 1912 Virginia married Leonard Woolf, a writer and social reformer. Three years later, her first novel <i>The Voyage Out </i>was published, followed by <i>Night and Day</i> (1919) and <i>Jacob's Room</i> (1922). These first novels show the development of Virginia Woolf's distinctive and innovative narrative style. It was during this time that she and Leonard Woolf founded The Hogarth Press with the publication of the co-authored <i>Two Stories</i> in 1917, hand-printed in the dining room of their house in Surrey. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> (1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel <i>The Waves</i> (1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive <i>Orlando </i>(1928) and <i>A Room of One's Own</i> (1929), a passionate feminist essay. This intense creative productivity was often matched by periods of mental illness, from which she had suffered since her mother's death in 1895. On March 28, 1941, a few months before the publication of her final novel, <i>Between the Acts</i>, Virginia Woolf committed suicide.&nbsp;� "The moment I begin to read that light, clear, elegant prose I am seduced... a masterpiece." --A.S. Byatt</p><h2>Forgotten Household Crafts</h2><p>A journey through the worlds of traditional craftspeople, from blacksmith to bee-keeper and wainwright to housewife, celebrates country arts and household crafts in an attractive, well-illustrated and photographed format that also includes information on materials, tools, and techniques.</p><p>Originally published in two separate volumes (<i>The Forgotten Arts</i> and <i>Forgotten Household Crafts</i>), this book brings under one cover the wisdom of John Seymour, a well-known thinker on matters of self-sufficiency, traditional arts, and voluntary simplicity. Seymour is a utopian--he has a vision of a better world where people aren't alienated from their labors. In the introduction he writes, "Are we justified in using articles, no matter how convenient it may be for us to use them, that we know were produced in conditions which bored and even stultified the human beings who had to make them?" This question led Seymour to the research that forms the foundation of the book: rediscovering natural ways of making tools, shoes, furniture, and a variety of other items using methods that follow the grain of wood or the idiosyncrasies of a piece of stone. Seymour respects what he calls "the discipline of natural materials," and he longs for a world free of "mass produced rubbish." Chapters cover an astonishing range: from clog making to spinning to canning. Since this book is intended as a comprehensive survey, don't expect to be an expert on, say, forging metal by reading Seymour's descriptions. He doesn't go into great detail; rather, he gives the basic facts of each forgotten labor of love, and it's up to readers to decide if it's a labor they want to undertake. <i>--Emily White</i>John Seymour was born in England in 1914. As a young man, he traveled all over Africa and fought in Burma in World War II. Returning penniless to England, he lived in a bus and a sailing barge before settling on five acres of land in the country to lead a self-sufficient life. He continues this lifestyle today with his companion Angela Ashe on the banks of the River Barrow in County Wexford, Ireland. The two have build up a small farm from scratch over the last 19 years. For the last four years, John, Angela, and William Sutherland have been running courses in self-sufficiency from their home at Killowen, New Ross. The courses are taken by students from al over the world, who come to Killowen to learn about John&#39;s lifestyle and philosophy at first hand. John Seymour is the author of over 40 books, including the best-selling Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency, and he has made numerous movies and radio programs. Most of his later writings and public campaigning have been devoted to rural matters, self-sufficiency, and the environment.</p><h2>Managing Life Skills Teacher Edition</h2><p>New and unused TE.

By merging and overlaying colours you can create soft velvety tones, rich textured or subtle effects, atmosphere, light and movement.

Four easy-to-follow practical demonstrations help you gain confidence and build up skills, illustrating all the techniques you need to know.</p><p>Peter Coombs first learned to paint with his artist mother when he was a child. As he grew up he progressed on to cartoons, oils and pastels. He started work, but decided to paint full time when he began receiving many commissions. He has exhibited in the UK, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, America, Canada, Japan and Australia. He has also appeared on television and given radio talks and interviews about his life as an artist, and his love of cricket.Nov 12 This is a &#34;new&#34; series from Search Press that raids their extensive and, let&#39;s be honest, excellent backlist. Once upon a time, my children, these books were part of the Leisure Arts series, something which itself went through more than one incarnation. These are the first two titles in what could be an extensive re-publishing programme. They&#39;re simple beginners&#39; guides (&#34;simple&#34; applies to the books, not the beginners, for the avoidance of confusion). What you get is a basic introduction to materials and equipment, some general notes on techniques and then some very short demonstrations that flex your muscles gently without any danger of over-exertion, all in 48 pages. I don&#39;t think anyone could learn to paint from just these books, but that&#39;s not what they were intended for. As a general introduction for someone putting a toe in the water - either as a complete novice or as a newcomer to the medium, they&#39;re a good way of easing yourself in. More perhaps than any other series, they absolutely stand or fall on how well the authors have understood the basic brief and, as Search Press usually contrive, they do it well. These were only ever intended to be pocket guides and, although the previous release was about A4 size, these new ones are only about half that. Normally, I don&#39;t like small-format books and I invariably fail to see the point of a book you can carry about with you. Give me illustrations I can see without my super-strength glasses, for goodness sake! However, I&#39;ve been seduced by the way these sit in the hand. They&#39;re slightly larger than the Top Tips series and I&#39;ve never complained about the size of the illustrations in those. It&#39;s also worth remarking that these books are a vindication of this site&#39;s policy of only reviewing from finished copies, rather than advance proofs. By getting the feel of the books in my hand, I&#39;ve discovered that what I originally thought was an incredibly bad idea actually works well. All-in-all, a good job has been done here. The material has been brought subtly up to date and some perfectly good books whose only crime is to be middle-aged have been brought back to life. At GBP4.99, they compare well with the old pricing, too. * Artbookreview.net * Oct 12 Find out how to use pastels with step by step instructions, techniques and good examples of finished work.

"I&#x2014; I've got something in my eye."</p><p>Grace Miller's young eyes chided her less-than-honest answer.</p><p>"Yes, I am crying. I shouldn't have fibbed about it. Please forgive me?" At the child's smile and nod, Rebecca continued, "It's just that, I never expected Mr. Cole to be dead." She'd never met the man she'd been engaged to marry in person, so the tears were more for her and what she'd lost than for Jesse Cole.</p><p>Rebecca tried to ignore the presence of U.S. Marshal Seth Billings, who stood beside the door. He had been the bearer of the bad news that her intended groom had been killed. Did he know she'd answered a mailorder-bride ad? Probably not.</p><p>He held his hat in his hands, waiting for her reaction. His broad shoulders seemed slumped under the tan shirt and brown vest he wore. There was a U.S. Marshal's star on his chest. Her gaze moved upward to where his sorrowful brown eyes bored into hers.</p><p>The rich texture of his voice drifted across the short space between them. "I'll be happy to pay your train ticket back to.. " He stopped and looked at her.</p><p>The question in his eyes prompted her to say, "Maryland?"</p><p>"Maryland." He nodded his head.</p><p>What did she have to go back to Maryland for? Her stepmother had made it clear she was no longer needed or welcome in her father's house. The only job available to her, a woman of twenty, was personal maid to the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in Ellicott City.</p><p>Rebecca didn't like the job or the daughter. No, Rebecca Ramsey would not be returning to Maryland anytime soon. She squared her shoulders and stood. "Thank you, Marshal, but that won't be necessary."</p><p>Seth Billings gritted his teeth; the muscles worked in his jaw. "What will you do, then?" His harsh words cut through her tattered emotions.</p><p>Fresh tears threatened to spill over. Rebecca cleared her throat. She wouldn't let it close up on her now. "I will think of something, Marshal. Thank you for coming by and telling me about..." She couldn't finish the sentence and the words hung in the tense room like the scent of burned bread. Rebecca focused on Grace's small back as the child went into the kitchen.</p><p>"Well," he said, turning back to the door, "if I can do anything to help you settle here in Cottonwood Springs, you let me know. Ya hear?"</p><p>Rebecca nodded, aware that the brown-eyed marshal no longer looked at her and really didn't expect an answer. The door shut behind him. She blew her nose on the white handkerchief she kept tucked into her sleeve for just such occasions.</p><p>Mrs. Miller came into the room, wiping her hands on her apron. The aroma of freshly baked apple pies drifted into the room with her. "Is he gone?"</p><p>Nine-year-old Grace followed her mother back into the room. The little girl bit into a green apple and chewed, her gaze never leaving Rebecca's face.</p><p>"Yes, he's gone."</p><p>The older woman eased into one of the overstuffed chairs. "So, now what are you going to do?"</p><p>Rebecca sighed. "I'm not sure." The Millers had housed her since she'd arrived five days earlier. They'd given her a room and three square meals and allowed her to sit with them during church on Sunday. How was she going to repay them?</p><p>Her plans had been to have Jesse take care of those expenses when he returned to town. Now she knew he wasn't coming. And she had no idea how to repay the debts she'd unknowingly accumulated.</p><p>Her temples began to ache. Silently she vowed to stay in New Mexico and not return to a family who didn't want her around. "I suppose I'll look for employment." She rubbed the sides of her head as she paced the floor.</p><p>"I don't think you have to make any rash decisions today, Rebecca. You've had a shock. Why don't you go lie down until supper?" Mrs. Miller smiled at her. Pity laced her eyes and filled her oversize face.</p><p>Rebecca hated that look. She'd seen it in the eyes of her father's friends many times after he'd remarried, and it wasn't a look she ever wanted to see again. "I think I'd rather have a breath of fresh air, if you don't mind. I would like to go for a walk." She pulled her wool shawl from the peg by the door and looked to Mrs. Miller.</p><p>"Go on, child. You have much to think about." Mrs. Miller pushed her immense body out of the chair and headed toward the kitchen. "Grace, come with me. You can peel potatoes for supper."</p><p>Rebecca slipped out the door and gently closed it behind her. Butterflies fluttered in her stomach. Her thoughts twisted in her mind as worry and doubt left her feeling faint. She sank into the chair beside the door.</p><p>She lowered her head and hid her face in her hands. She and Jesse had been planning to buy a small farm, raise fruit trees and chickens once they were married. Rebecca sighed, but now Jesse was gone and thanks to her stepmother, she couldn't go home.</p><p>Before her mother died, Rebecca's life had been one of ease and love. Her father, a businessman, enjoyed the warmth of their home as much as she and her sister had, so it had been no surprise that he'd remarried shortly after her mother's death.</p><p>After that day, life had changed for Rebecca. Her jealous stepmother had kept her busy and away from her only living parent. She'd made her feel uncomfortable in the only home she'd ever known. The woman had been sweet in the presence of her husband and vinegar in his absence.</p><p>By the time her stepmother had forced her to answer the mailorder-bride ad that Jesse had placed, she'd been ready to leave. She was ready to get away and start a family of her own.</p><p>Rebecca desired someone to love her, to make her feel safe and wanted again. She'd thought Jesse Cole was the answer to her prayers. He'd seemed to be stable and to know what he wanted out of life. His letters had promised security and love. Now she knew that wasn't to be, at least not with Jesse.</p><p>She missed her father and longed to go home, if only he would stand up to her stepmother. Rebecca knew that would never happen. No, she had to figure out what to do, on her own and with no help from her father.</p><p><i>Lord, what am I going to do now? I don't want to go home and I'm not sure how I will be able to stay here. Why did Jesse have to die?</i></p><p>Seth hated days like today. The shattered look in her eyes had revealed that Rebecca Ramsey felt as if all were lost. Why hadn't Jesse just surrendered? He would have been in jail, but at least he would have been alive.</p><p>Jesse had begged Seth as he bled out from his gut wound, "Please watch for Rebecca Ramsey, Marshal. She was to be my bride." Their last conversation continued to play in his mind. "She didn't do anything to deserve this. I really wanted to start a fresh life with her. Please take care of her. Please!"</p><p>The easy gait of the horse allowed Seth to recall his answer. "I'll see that she's taken care of, Jesse."</p><p>Jesse clutched his shirt and pulled him closer. "Don't let Maxwell or any of the Evans gang near her. They'll try to take her."</p><p>Jesse's fear for Rebecca was real and Seth found himself saying the words he knew the dying man wanted to hear. "I'll protect her, Jesse. That's a promise."</p><p>With Seth's words, peace entered the young man's eyes and then Jesse Cole took his final breath. Twenty-two was too young to die. Jesse had only been three years younger than himself. Seth shook his head at the sadness of the past week.</p><p>Memories of Jesse flooded his mind. Jesse had arrived in Cottonwood Springs six years ago. Nobody knew anything about him, just that he worked hard at the livery where old man Rodgers had given him a job. Then he'd taken up with Maxwell Evans and his brother. For four years he'd run with Maxwell, his brother Clod and Horace Nance.</p><p>The four men made up the Evans gang. They had been more a nuisance than a real gang. They'd stolen small things and the men of Cottonwood Springs didn't feel the need to press charges against them. Boys will be boys, as the old saying goes. Old man Rodgers died one night and Jesse moved in with Maxwell.</p><p>And then one night Jesse ran into Reverend James Griffin and found the Lord. Jesse turned his life around that night; he started working on the Vaughan farm just a couple of miles out of town. The other Evans gang members hadn't been thrilled with the turnabout and they'd given the Vaughan family plenty of trouble.</p><p>Over the next two years the Evans gang had grown and become braver. Their crimes had developed into more serious transgressions. With each passing year, Maxwell had become more dangerous.</p><p>Seth hadn't been surprised when they'd robbed the bank in Durango. What had surprised him was when the smoke cleared, Jesse had been the one left to die on the bank floor. He shook his head again. Jesse hadn't even carried a gun. What had he been doing robbing a bank with no gun?</p><p>Guilt slammed into Seth's gut. He'd shot down an unarmed man. Never had he felt the gravity of being a U.S. Marshal as strongly as he did now. The law was behind him, but he still felt as if a small part of his own soul had been ripped from his body the day Jesse Cole died. No matter how many times he played the events of that day in his mind, it came out the same. He'd killed an unarmed man, he'd killed Jesse Cole.</p><p>Thankfully the Vaughan orchard came into view. He shook his head and muttered, "I need to stop dwelling on it. Jesse is gone and there's nothing I can do about it now." Seth gave a little kick of his boots against the horse's sides and sent it into a trot. It was time to go tell Mr. Vaughan that his hired hand wasn't comi...</p></p><h2>And No Birds Sang</h2><p>A personal account of Mowat&#39;s coming of age during World War II, when, as an inexperienced, underweight, and underage youth he joined the Canadian forces, chronicles his conversion from eager, patriotic youth into a battleweary warrior</p><p>On September 2, 1939, Farley Mowat was painting the porch of his family&#39;s home when his ebullient father drove into the driveway and shouted, &#34;Farley, my lad, there&#39;s big bloody news!

Historians have held for centuries that the majestic tapestry?almost 300 feet in length?trumpets the glory of William the Conqueror and the victorious Normans. But is this true? In <i>1066,</i> Andrew Bridgeford reveals a very different story that reinterprets and recasts the most decisive year in English history.<br><br>Reading the tapestry as if it were a written text, examining each scene with fresh eyes, Bridgeford discovers a wealth of new information subversively and ingeniously encoded in the threads, which appears to undermine the Norman point of view while presenting a secret tale undetected for centuries?an account of the final years of Anglo-Saxon England quite different from the Norman version of events. In the midst of it all is a mysterious French nobleman?Count Eustace II of Boulogne, descended from Charlemagne?whose own claim to the English throne rivaled Duke William's.<br><br>While building his case, Bridgeford brings to life the turbulent eleventh century in western Europe, a world of ambitious warrior bishops, court dwarfs, ruthless knights, and powerful women. <i>1066 </i>offers readers a rare surprise?a book that reconsiders a long-accepted masterpiece and chain of events?and sheds new light on a pivotal chapter in English history. "A gripping yarn . . . An exciting account of the tapestry's busy drama and engaging realism."?<i>The Daily Telegraph</i><br><br>"A highly readable and haunting book."?<b><i>Daily Mail</i></b> <br><br>"Bridgeford marshals the battalions of his argument with analytical force, lucidity, and panache."?<i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)&nbsp;"The Bayeux Tapestry, in the French town of Bayeux, draws half a million visitors a year. For more than 900 years it has been kept?and sometimes concealed?in several places around the town. The story of the Norman invasion of England in 1066 is set out in this masterpiece, recounting the Battle of Hastings, culminating in a victory for William the Conqueror and the death of King Harold. Although barely half a metre wide, the tapestry is about 70 metres long, embroidered on a plain linen background in wools of red, yellow, gray, green, and blue. Here are men feasting on birds, drinking from ivory horns, hunting, going to church, and loading provisions onto a ship. Bridgeford posits 'the quest of [his] book is to unravel the millennial mysteries of the work, to investigate the true origin and meaning of it, to understand more about the characters who are named in it, and to gain a new insight into some of the darkest events of the Norman Conquest.' The result is a fascinating study."?<b><i>Booklist </i></b><br><br>"Definitely not the Norman version. The Battle of Hastings, in 1066, when the last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold, was defeated by William the Conqueror, is one of the world's most commented-upon battles, partly because its effects (the fusion of French and Anglo-Saxon into English, for example) ramify to this day?and partly because it was illustrated by the near-contemporary Bayeux Tapestry, a masterpiece of Medieval art. What is there new to add to the library of references? Bridgeford attempts to overturn at least two old verities about the battle. According to the author, 'close observation of the Bayeux Tapestry reveals that it is not a work of Norman propaganda that popular myth would have us believe, but a covert, subtle, and substantial record of the English version of events.' He makes a very strong case by comparing real Norman propaganda, which is codified in William of Poitier's <i>The Deeds of Duke William</i> (circa 1070), with the Bayeux's scenes. Scene by scene, the Bayeux tapestry deviates significantly in its sympathetic treatment of Harold from the simple-minded vilification to which he was subjected after his death at Hastings. Bridgeford goes to less used sources, such as Eadmar's <i>The History of Recent Events in England</i> (circa 1090), to understand the images. If he's right, then another supposed fact about the tapestry?that it was commissioned by William's half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux?seems unlikely. Bridgeford believes, instead, that the tapestry was commissioned by William's occasional ally Count Eustace of Boulogne as a peace offering to Odo, with whom Eustace was often in violent conflict. This is solid historical detective work, enlivened with extensive speculations about the tapestry's mysteries (Bridgeford, for instance, has a fascinating theory about why a dwarf named Turold holds a special place in the story). On sound empirical ground, Bridgeford's work will no doubt generate much heat and some light among students of English history."?<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><p><p><b>Andrew Bridgeford</b> is a lawyer and historian. He lives on the Isle of Jersey in the United Kingdom.</p>The simple linen background and bright woolen colors of the Bayeux Tapestry have always been interpreted as a French tribute to William the Conqueror, celebrating his victory over England in 1066 with its depiction of soldiers, archers, ships and battles. In an often riveting but ultimately unconvincing revisionist account drawing on the work of other scholars as well as on contemporary accounts of events, Bridgeford, a British lawyer, argues that the tapestry was more likely designed by English monks at St. Augustine's abbey in Canterbury under the direction of Count Eustace of Boulogne. English women, more famous for their embroidery skills than the French, stitched a tapestry containing a covert anti-Norman message. Bridgeford also provides details on minor characters in the tapestry, such as the dwarf Turold&#x2014;who Bridgeford thinks might have written the medieval French epic poem <i>Chanson de Roland</i> and been the tapestry's patron&#x2014;and Aelfgyva, the only woman named on the tapestry. While Bridgeford offers a fascinating look into the tapestry and the events it depicts, his language and method are so tentative ("Could it be that...?") that one is left doubting his interpretation. 16 pages of color illus., one map. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For nineteen years this was the limit of my world, then one midsummer morning I left home and walked to London and down the blazing length of Spain during the innocent days of the early thirties. Never had I felt so fat with time, so free to go where I would. Then such indulgence was suddenly broken by the savage outbreak of the Civil War . . .&#39; - Laurie Lee</p><p>Laurie Lee has written some of the best-loved travel books in the English language. Born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 1914, he was educated at Slad village school and Stroud Central School. At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then travelled on foot through Spain, where he was trapped by the outbreak of the Civil War. He later returned by crossing the Pyrenees, as he recounted in A Moment of War. Laurie Lee published four collections of poems: The Sun My Monument (1944), The Bloom of Candles (1947), My Many-Coated Man (1955) and Pocket Poems (1960). His other works include The Voyage of Magellan (1948), The Firstborn (1964), I Can&#39;t Stay Long (1975), and Two Women (1983). He also wrote three bestselling volumes of autobiography: Cider with Rosie (1959), which has sold over six million copies worldwide, As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969) and A Moment of War (1991).</p><h2>The Red Signal (Living Books Romance)</h2><p>Book by Hill, Grace Livingston</p><p>Grace Livingston Hill</p><h2>Are You There God? It&#39;s Me Margaret.</h2><p>Faced with the difficulties of growing up and choosing a religion, eleven- going on twelve-year-old Margaret talks over her problems with her own private God.</p><p>If anyone tried to determine the most common rite of passage for preteen girls in North America, a girl's first reading of <i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</i> would rank near the top of the list. Judy Blume and her character Margaret Simon were the first to say out loud (and in a book even) that it is normal for girls to wonder when they are <i>ever</i> going to fill out their training bras. Puberty is a curious and annoying time. Girls' bodies begin to do freakish things--or, as in Margaret's case, they don't do freakish things nearly as fast as girls wish they would. Adolescents are often so relieved to discover that someone understands their body-angst that they miss one of the book's deeper explorations: a young person's relationship with God. Margaret has a very private relationship with God, and it's only after she moves to New Jersey and hangs out with a new friend that she discovers that it might be weird to talk to God without a priest or a rabbi to mediate. Margaret just wants to fit in! Who is God, and where is He when she needs Him? She begins to look into the cups of her training bra for answers ...For Margaret, everything is different this year. She&#39;s just moved from New York City to the suburbs and is anxious to fit in with her new friends--Nancy, Gretchen, and Janie. When they form a secret club to talk about private subjects like boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret is happy to belong. But in Farbrook, everybody joins the Y or the Jewish Community Center. Margaret doesn&#39;t have a religion, so what&#39;s she supposed to do? Suddenly life is very confusing. Maybe it&#39;s all part of growing up, but Margaret could really use some answers.</p><h2>The Wonder Weeks Milestone Guide: Your Baby's Development, Sleep &amp; Crying Explained</h2><p><p><strong>The Go-To book covering all you need to know about your baby&#x2019;s physical, emotional and mental development, as well as sleep, crying, diet, stress, intelligence and health.

Far from just copying medieval buildings, it was a style full of color and invention, in which its exponents created a daring new approach to design. Throwing out the old Classical rule book, Gothic Revival architects like Augustus Welby Pugin and George Gilbert Scott designed buildings which were asymmetrical in form and visually expressive of their function. It went beyond just bricks and mortar and had a strong moral code, the influence of which was still felt into the 20th century. In this illustrated book, Trevor Yorke tells the story of the Gothic Revival from its origins in the whimsical fancies of the Georgian Period through to its High Victorian climax.</p><p><b>Trevor Yorke</b> is a professional author and artist who has studied and written about all aspects of England's architectural heritage. He has produced over 30 illustrated books that introduce the reader to these fascinating historic gems and writes articles and reviews for various magazines.

A gripping historical thriller from the bestselling author of <i>Fatherland</i>.<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 1895. On a freezing morning in the heart of Paris, an army officer, Georges Picquart, witnesses a convicted spy, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, being publicly humiliated in front of twenty thousand spectators baying 'Death to the Jew!'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>officer</i> is rewarded with promotion: Picquart is made the French army's youngest colonel and put in command of 'the Statistical Section' -- the shadowy intelligence unit that tracked down Dreyfus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>spy</i>, meanwhile, is given a punishment of medieval cruelty: Dreyfus is shipped off to a lifetime of solitary confinement on Devil's Island -- unable to speak to anyone, not even his guards, his case seems closed forever.<br>But gradually Picquart comes to believe there is something rotten at the heart of the Statistical Section. When he discovers another German spy operating on French soil, his superiors are oddly reluctant to pursue it. Despite official warnings, Picquart persists, and soon the officer and the spy are in the same predicament.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrated by Picquart, <i>An Officer and a Spy</i> is a compelling recreation of a scandal that became the most famous miscarriage of justice in history. Compelling, too, are the echoes for our modern world: an intelligence agency gone rogue, justice corrupted in the name of national security, a newspaper witch-hunt of a persecuted minority, and the age-old instinct of those in power to cover-up their crimes.<br><br></p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, February 2014:</strong> A spy thriller and psychological examination, Robert Harris&#x2019;s <em>An Officer and a Spy</em> looks at the infamous Dreyfus affair through the personage of a functionary-turned-whistle-blower. It&#x2019;s Paris, 1895. A Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, has been convicted of treason and is imprisoned on Devil&#x2019;s Island; he has been publicly humiliated, bound in chains, banished to solitary confinement. But was he really a spy for Germany--or was his fate sealed because he was a Jew in an anti-Semitic time and place? Slowly, the petit bureaucrat Georges Picquart begins to suspect that Dreyfus--portrayed here mostly through heart-wrenching real-life letters he wrote from prison to his beloved family--has been scapegoated. As Picquart amasses more and more evidence about Dreyfus, he also must come to terms with some of his own behaviors and attitudes. Still, for all its delicious detail about the mores of Belle Epoque Paris, both social and political, this novel is also one for the ages, or at least for the ages in which powerful intelligence agencies, government surveillance and cover-ups are worrisomely becoming the norm. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of eight bestselling novels: <i>Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost, Lustrum</i> and <i>The Fear Index</i>.

From their cheerless digs in a local stately home, Dandy and Alec track Vesper Kemp, the ferrywoman, to a tiny tidal island. She seems to have lost her mind, roaming the beaches in rags, ranting about snakes and mercury. What is even more troubling, is that Vesper claims she murdered Peter Haslett, a young man who fell into the river, trying to row past one of its four water mills, and drowned. A group of worried Cramond residents - the minister, the innkeeper and the lady of the big house - are determined that Vesper is innocent. But with the four local millers themselves remaining oddly tight-lipped and with all the suspicious strangers who lurk about the village, Dandy and Alec have their work cut out for them. And they closer they get to the answers they seek, the stronger the sense that great danger lies beneath the surface of these murky waters.</p><p></p><h2>Beneficial Bombing: The Progressive Foundations of American Air Power, 1917-1945 (Studies in War, Society, and the Military)</h2><p><p>The Progressive Era, marked by a desire for economic, political, and social reform, ended for most Americans with the ugly reality and devastation of World War I. Yet for Army Air Service officers, the carnage and waste witnessed on the western front only served to spark a new progressive movement&#x2014;to reform war by relying on destructive technology as the instrument of change. In <i>Beneficial Bombing</i> Mark Clodfelter describes how American airmen, horrified by World War I&#x2019;s trench warfare, turned to the Progressive Era&#x2019;s ideas of efficiency and economy in an effort to reform war itself, with the heavy bomber as their solution to limiting the bloodshed. They were convinced that the airplane, used as a bombing platform, offered the means to make wars less lethal than conflicts waged by armies or navies.</p><p></p><p>Clodfelter examines the progressive idealism that led to the creation of the U.S. Air Force and its doctrine that the finite destruction of precision bombing would end wars more quickly and with less suffering for each belligerent. His work, moreover, shows how these progressive ideas emerged intact after World War II to become the foundation of modern U.S. Air Force doctrine. Drawing on a wealth of archival material, including critical documents unavailable to previous researchers, Clodfelter presents the most complete analysis to date of the doctrinal development underpinning current U.S. Air Force notions about strategic bombing.</p></p><p>Mark Clodfelter is a professor of military strategy at the National War College.

Her father denies the possibility of a political motive. There are no signs of struggle, no evidence of sexual assault, leaving psychologist Alex Delaware and his friend LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis to pose the disturbing question: <i>Why</i>?<br><br>Working together with Daniel Sharavi, a brilliant Israeli police inspector, Delaware and Sturgis soon find themselves ensnared in one of the darkest, most menacing cases of their careers. And when death strikes again, it is Alex who must go undercover, alone, to expose an unthinkable conspiracy of self-righteous brutality and total contempt for human life.</p><p>Legendary L.A. psychologist-turned-novelist Kellerman raids real life when inventing the adventures of his psychologist sleuth, Dr. Alex Delaware, and some of the scariest parts of <i>Survival of the Fittest</i> are historical. Eugenicists lurk behind a murder spree Alex must solve, and he notes that the eugenics movement involved one elite U.S. college professor who advocated castration of ethnically lesser men, a forced sterilization ordered by Supreme Court Justice Holmes that Hitler used as a precedent to sterilize millions, and the pre-Holocaust coinage of the phrase "final solution." <p> Besides a truly horrifying theme, <i>Survival of the Fittest</i> boasts sharp but not arch dialogue; savvy psychological insights into stressed-out cops, suicides' loved ones, and malevolent therapists; and a sense of place so vivid that the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> has rated Kellerman the most evocative L.A. author since Raymond Chandler.</p><p> The plot's as twisty as a canyon road, and it's great fun to ride along with Dr. Alex and his sidekick, the burly, gay LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, as they dodge large red herrings and strive to find out why mildly handicapped kids are suffering "gentle strangulation" by killers who sign their handiwork with the mysterious letters <i>DVLL</i>, and what the devil this has to do with the high-IQ group Meta. Bonus for Kellerman fans: his Israeli serial killer catcher, Daniel Sharavi, star of his 1988 bestseller <i>The Butcher's Theater</i>, joins the sleuth team.

W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow.

Now in a mini edition, this remarkable illustrated book allows us to venture back to the Golden Age of Illustration so that we may discover the work and personalities of the women who were previously unnamed. Susan Fenimore Cooper wrote books about the flora and fauna of upstate New York in the 1850s while living in service to her famous father, James. Mrs. E.W. Wirt, the mother of twelve, compiled and illustrated books about flowers to amuse and educate her children. Elizabeth Blackwell drew 500 botanical plates to raise money to free her husband from debtor&#x2019;s prison. These are only a few of the artists we call Women of Flowers. Since the early 1970s, horticultural expert Jack Kramer has been collecting works by Victorian women artists. Women of Flowers is his tribute to those women who received so little credit in their own day and age. Over 150 floral paintings and prints illustrate the life stories of 35 women artists from America, England, Germany, and France. In this elegant and charming gift book, hundreds of dazzling full-color floral paintings and botanical prints illustrate the fascinating life stories of Victorian women artists who made tremendous contributions to the art and science of botany. Most received little or no recognition for their work due to the patriarchal Victorian society that they lived in. <i>Women of Flowers</i> pays homage to these remarkable artists in a volume that compiles not only their history and biographies but also some of their best work.</p><p>Women of Flowers gives these women artists the attention they deserve, in a book of exceptional and charm.&#34;In the places most difficult to access I found the most beautiful flowers.

The only clues to his past are the name of his hometown and an antique glass water bottle that he&#39;s kept his entire life.Arriving in West Baden with the bottle and a camera, Shaw begins to have vivid and disturbing visions. And the more he finds out about the town and the man, the more he suspects that something besides the West Baden Springs Hotel has just been restored . . . Something dark and terrifying. And cold.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2010</strong>: Award-winning author Michael Koryta's first foray into the supernatural genre is spellbinding and check-your-doors-and-windows scary, and it all begins with a check and a bottle of water. Filmmaker Eric Shaw had a knack for getting the exact right shot--an unexplained tug that unerringly put him on the right path--until his temper killed his Hollywood career. He gets a shot at redemption when a wealthy young woman commissions a video tribute for her father-in-law, a dying millionaire named Campbell Bradford. A man with a shady past, a town with a rich history, and an antique bottle of water claiming to "cure all ills" lead Shaw to small town West Baden, where things quickly go sideways. Shaw finds himself at odds with Bradford's only surviving family, a bitter and violent great-grandson named Josiah, and that once familiar tug of Shaw's becomes something darker and more dangerous. At its deliciously creepy core, <em>So Cold the River</em> is about two men facing down their demons, and what happens when those demons fight back. --<em>Daphne Durham</em><em></em>Michael Koryta&#39;s novels have won the LA Times Book Prize and the Great Lakes Book Award and been nominated for the Edgar, Shamus, Quill and Barry awards.

In addition to writing front page headlines and &#x201c;putting out&#x201d; the first edition, even as an executive, Paul Sann never stopped being a reporter.

Lindsay under the guise of an &#x201c;urban affairs expert,&#x201d; but really to write the story of the dissident Moscow Jews battling to emigrate to Israel. In October of that year, when the Yom Kippur War broke out, Sann, then 59, flew to Israel to report on the war firsthand.

They are first and second in the Premier League, but today only one man can come out on top.

Barcelona, late-nineties: Johan Cruyff&#39;s Dream Team is disintegrating and the revolutionary manager has departed, but what will come next will transform the future of football.

The Barcelona Legacy is a book in part about tactics, about how the theories that underpin the modern game were forged by Cruyff and his successors, but also about the people and personalities who gathered at the Camp Nou for what was effectively the greatest coaching seminar in history, about their friendships and rivalries and, in one case, an apocalyptic falling out that continues to shape the game today.</p><p></p><h2>Maine&#39;s Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People</h2><p><p><strong>This first comprehensive book on Maine&#x2019;s black history is a mosaic of early history, slavery, the Underground Railroad, arts, sciences, law, politics, civil rights, education, religion, military, and sports. Forty-two contributors write about black families |and communities.</strong></p><p>Black men and women have been integral parts of Maine culture and society since the beginning of the colonial era. Indeed, Mainers of African descent served in every American conflict from the King Philip's War to the present. However, the many contributions of blacks in shaping Maine and the nation have, for a number of reasons, gone largely unacknowledged.<strong>&nbsp; Maine's Visible Black History</strong> now uncovers and reveals a rich and long-neglected strata of state history and proves a very real connection to regional and national events. Drawing on the excellent writing of contributors Herb Adams, William David Barry, Beverly Dodge Bowens, Stephen Ellis, Leigh Donaldson, Bob Greene, Douglas Hall, Charles L. Lumpkins, Reginald Pitts, Marcia Robinson, Geneva McAuley Sherrer, Helene Ertha Vann, and others, the project covers many facets of history including slavery in Maine (which lasted until 1783), work, religions, family, education, military service, community, social change, arts and science, sports, politics, law, civil rights, underground railroad, and the contributions of individual men and women.</p><p>There are appendices, resources for students, and an index. The book's extraordinary illustrations document black life from Aroostook County to York County through the centuries. &nbsp;</p><p>Authors/Editors Price and Talbot, with the many contributing writers, are owed a lasting debt. They have given us a substantive, often poignant volume that deserves a place on every Maine bookshelf. Never again will anyone seriously suggest that black people have played little or no role in the development of Maine.</p> B&amp;W photographs and drawings</p><p>"'Maine's Visible History' marks a new stage in the history of African Americans in Maine and the United States. It is a lavishly illustrated tapestry of personal reminiscences, local, state, and national history that makes us reconsider what we thought we knew. It brings together professional and local historians, genealogists and storytellers, participants and narrators in an accessible, fascinating, and groundbreaking way. African Amerian history has always been about black populations large enough that black people could form institutions to affect their relationships with the prevailing community. In Maine the black population was so small that blacks could only form micro versions of those institutions to protect themselves from the assaults of the dominant society. Their perserverance in the face of the tremendous odds against them is not only a testament to the human spirit but provides examples that allow us to see how these institutions were formed. 'Maine's Visible Black History' is a grassroots account of African American individuals and small black communites building the institutions that enabled them to carve out lives and get a tiny piece of the promise of America." -Randolph Stakeman, Ph.D., Associate Professor of African Studies and History, Director of the Africana Studies Program, and Director of the John Brown Russwurm African American Center at Bowdoin College. <p>"'Maine's Visible Black History' is a remarkable achievement, vividly bringing to life hundreds of years of Maine's long obscured African American history! From the earliest days of pre-colonial settlement, Black Mainers have helped forge and build a New England commonwealth. They struggled through slavery and freedom, discrimination and liberation, to create and maintain families, communities, and institutions, from Maine's coastal islands to inland mill towns and logging centers. Meticulously researched, infused with rich personal and community oral stories, 'Maine's Visible Black History' will surprise and delight its readers. This book has reclaimed a history in danger of being lost forever and shares with us Maine's African American citizens' rightful place in the fabric of the state's long history." -Kate Clifford Larson, Ph.D., author, "Bound For the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero"</p><p>H.

In harrowing detail, Ryan documents the preponderance of abuse, eating disorders, weakened bones, and damaged psyches that are often the result of intensive training. 16-page photo insert.</p><p>Joan Ryan is a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle.Ryan, an award-winning columnist for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, offers disturbing anecdotal evidence indicating that women's gymnastics and figure skating are physically and psychologically damaging to a majority of participants with realistic Olympic aspirations. Ryan's emphasis is on gymnastics; figure skating is a cutthroat sport, to be sure, and it encourages bulimia, but compared to gymnastics, it's almost pristine. Ryan documents that between the years 1976^-92, the average U.S. Olympic gymnast became a year younger, six and one-half inches shorter, and 23 pounds lighter. The sport not only attracts tiny girls, it manufactures them: these days the demanding physical requirements of championship women's gymnastics can only be met by prepubescent, very light, very flexible girls. Control their weight through intimidation, delay the onset of puberty via exhaustion and starvation, and voila{&nbsp;}! You've got little girls forever. But by delaying puberty, one also inhibits the production of estrogen, which is essential for adult bone density. There are now former gymnasts in their twenties with the bone density of 90-year-olds. Equally damaging is the obsession with weight passed on to young gymnasts by their coaches. Onetime Olympic hopeful Christie Henrich weighed less than 50 pounds when she slipped into a coma in July_ 1994 and died. Ryan portrays the gymnastic training of Olympic hopefuls as systemic, sanctioned child abuse. It's a nightmare vision that may forever change one's image of those herculean efforts by such Olympian pixies as Olga Korbutt and Mary Lou Retton.

Reprint.</p><p><strong>Kristen D. Randle</strong> lives with her husband, four children, and two dogs in a little wood on the banks of a Utah river. She and her husband manage their own recording studio. The award-winning The Only Alien on the Planet is one of several novels she has written.New student Ginny is intrigued by the handsome alien in her homeroom?no, this is not a science fiction novel. Smitty?real name Michael?is known to his schoolmates as "The Alien" because of his affectless appearance and complete silence. Soon, Ginny and Smitty's longtime protector, Caulder, team up to try and crack his shell. They get much more than they bargain for when they drag him along on old-movie outings; as a none-too-subtle plot device, the first turns out to be The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, the second, East of Eden. Smitty walks out of both, for it turns out that he was almost fatally abused by his older brother, who also convinced him that he would die if he spoke to anyone. With the help of Ginny, Caulder and a wise and sympathetic therapist, Smitty emerges from this psychological curse, and he and Ginny even begin a tentative romantic relationship. Randle (Why Did Grandma Have to Die?) unfortunately builds her otherwise well-crafted novel around an uncharacteristic response to abuse. Under his pain, Smitty is totally honest and caring?a very romantic figure, but not one likely to be found in the real world.

Inspired by true events, this story tells of four lions that escape from the Baghdad Zoo during a bombing raid in 2003 and encounter other animals that offer unique perspectives, such as a tortoise that survived World War I. They begin to question the nature of freedom. Can it be achieved without being earned? What is its price? What do the lions owe the zookeepers who took care of them at the cost of keeping them in captivity? Where should they go? What should they eat? The four lions soon realize that a desert city is nothing like the grassy savannas of their memories. Their experiences mirror those of the Iraqi citizens displaced by the conflict.

Goddard teaches at the University of Hartford and Trinity College.A lively, sometimes polemical, but often persuasive look at the rise and decline of the once-mighty railroads and the ills of America's exclusive reliance on the ``highway-motor complex.'' The car and the interstate highway are today such pervasive features of the American landscape that it is difficult for Americans to realize that 100 years ago most cities and towns were linked only by often impassable dirt roads and by railroads. Because of this, attorney Goddard shows, railroads wielded enormous power and influence during the 19th century, incurring the enmity of other interests, especially farmers. At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of bicycles and automobiles created a demand for good roads. But, Goddard contends, it was during the First World War, when the flow of American war materiel overwhelmed the nation's rails, that American policy makers recognized the importance of developing a good national highway network. As a result, beginning in the 1920s, government, road builders, and automobile makers joined in promoting cars over railroads: ``By 1930, a dense network of interconnected paved roads linked every corner of America, and Detroit produced millions of cars and trucks that cut dramatically into the railroad business.'' This culminated in the Eisenhower administration's massive drive to upgrade interstate highways. After dwelling on the railroad's steep decline and the apparent total victory of cars and highways, Goddard discusses environmental and other ills that have attended the explosive growth of the highways, contending that, in order to remain competitive in a global economy, America will have to develop alternatives to cars and highways without relinquishing them: Among these might be high-speed rail lines and computer- guided urban traffic systems. A first-rate look at the history and problems of American mass transportation. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Trouble is, thoselonely slide-guitar notes have also attracted a colossal seabeast named Steve with a, shall we say, thing for explosiveoil tanker trucks. Suddenly morose Pine Cove turns libidinous and is filled with mysterious crimes, and a beleaguered constable has to fight off his own gonzo appetites to find out what's wrong and what, if anything, to do about it.</p><p>Strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen. It's Christopher Moore time.</p></p><p>Reading a Christopher Moore novel is a little like eating a potato chip--it's hard to stop at just one. And you don't have to look beyond the titles to understand the allure; who could pass up a book called <i>Practical Demonkeeping</i> or <i>Island of the Sequined Love Nun</i>? Each of Moore's tales skewers a particular literary genre. In <i>Coyote Blue</i> he nailed New Age fascination with Native American religion; in <i>Blood-Sucking Fiends: A Love Story</i> he put a new twist on the classic vampire tale. <i>The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove</i> is a companion piece to his first novel, the hilariously twisted horror story <i>Practical Demonkeeping</i>, and readers of that book will recognize the setting, Pine Cove, California. In addition, Moore includes plenty of his patented weird sex, occasional gross-out death, several off-kilter but nonetheless affecting love stories, and some fabulous secondary characters such as Mavis Sand: <blockquote> Mavis first began augmenting her parts in the fifties, first out of vanity: breasts, eyelashes, hair. Later, as she aged and the concept of maintenance eluded her, she began having parts replaced as they failed, until almost half of her body weight was composed of stainless steel (hips, elbows, shoulders, finger joints, rods fused to vertebrae five through twelve), silicon wafers (hearing aids, pacemaker, insulin pump), advanced polymer resins (cataract replacement lenses, dentures), Kevlar fabric (abdominal wall reinforcement), titanium (knees, ankles), and pork (ventricular heart valve). </blockquote> In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a gigantic prehistoric lizard whose slumber deep beneath the ocean surface is interrupted by a radioactive leak from a nearby power plant. At the same time, a woman in Pine Cove hangs herself; the local psychiatrist (who has been prescribing antidepressants to everyone in town with gay abandon) decides the suicide was her fault and yanks everyone's medication; and an elderly black blues singer named Catfish Jefferson arrives to perform at the Head of the Slug saloon. Into this already strange brew mix one schizoid former B-movie starlet, a pot-head town constable, a bereaved local artist, a biologist tracking anomalous behavior in rats, a crooked sheriff, and a pharmacist with a bizarre sexual fixation on sea mammals, and you have a recipe for the kind of madness Moore does so well. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Christopher Moore is the author of five previous novels.

Yet this is also a narrative that does full justice to the leading episodes and characters of the Bank, while taking care to evoke a real sense of the place itself, with its often distinctively domestic side.</p><p>Deploying an array of piquant and revealing material from the Bank's rich archives, <i>Till Time's Last Sand </i>is a multi-layered and insightful portrait of one of our most important national institutions, from one of our leading historians.</p></p><p><b>David Kynaston</b> was born in Aldershot in 1951.

What the reader gets is an exemplary narrative history, with the archives plundered judiciously and plenty of focus on people and their quirks . . .

Then it turned brittle cold. The day we left I couldn&#x2019;t distinguish between the fog and the puff of my breath.<br> <br>In Frankfurt, we were informed that Stravinsky had suffered a stroke conducting in Berlin and was not expected to live. Almost nothing could have upset George more than the possible loss of his artistic father, collaborator, and friend. He couldn&#x2019;t sleep at night, and I ended up sleeping in Mother&#x2019;s room to get the rest I needed for performance. Everyone felt the pall of his gloom.<br> <br>Making it worse, George and I weren&#x2019;t getting along. I suspected that he was infatuated with Diana Adams, another dancer in the company who happened to be my best friend. I had no real evidence. My husband, far as I could see, attended to the usual sprains and emergencies, rehearsed replacements that had to be made. But I could feel it.<br> <br>We called the long, late summer and autumn tour of 1956 the German tour, because of Stravinsky prostrate in Berlin. The previous year, so very different, we&#x2019;d begun in Nice, on to the flowers and sea and palm trees of Monte Carlo. The grand duchess came backstage with a bouquet from the prince of Monaco. I didn&#x2019;t like crowded Marseille, the rough stage ripped the satin right off our shoes. From there we took the train to Lyon, where they gave us a lovely reception in the park and the mayor invited us to the palace. Florence in May was warm and sunny, and we danced on a huge stage with a good floor. I didn&#x2019;t care for Lisbon, we were like film stars there, the people threw belts, ribbons, men&#x2019;s collars to autograph, they&#x2019;d clutch at our clothes, and I couldn&#x2019;t understand a word they said. In France it was easy for me, and in Italy too, though I don&#x2019;t speak Italian. In Italy I spoke French, English, and pantomime. In Stuttgart I bought beautiful cobalt-blue pottery and two feather quilts, rose and moss green. Amsterdam was exquisite, the canals, the paved streets, and the little white houses.<br> <br>I thought of that tour lying awake in Mother&#x2019;s room throughout our stay in Frankfurt, then in Brussels, with the days getting shorter and colder, as if the earlier tour were extant, parallel, proof that happiness and ease weren&#x2019;t myths.<br> <br>In Antwerp I spun off the stage and nearly fell in the wings, catching myself by clutching at ropes. Upright again, I was soaked through with sweat. Mouths moved on girls rushing by, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear them. Somebody had shut off the sound, and the girls looked like ghosts. Sounds shot back and boomed, and I started violently shaking.<br> <br>George came to my dressing room, a cramped trap that had a wide upholstered chair, where I huddled, cloaked in my old flannel bathrobe. He got in the chair beside me and rubbed my arms, and I calmed.<br> <br>&#x201c;No more sleeping with Mama,&#x201d; he said. I could see he was worried about me. We had just learned Stravinsky was stable, and I tried not to link George&#x2019;s openness and care to mere relief.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t love me,&#x201d; I said. He didn&#x2019;t answer, but he didn&#x2019;t leave.<br> <br>In the morning I felt better. Mother said if I lost one more ounce, the audience wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see me. Since Venice she hovered, bringing me milkshakes thick with cream, white as her hair. It was quite strange because overall I was dancing effectively. I would drink Mother&#x2019;s elixir, gag down a couple pieces of steak, and go on as if my muscles weren&#x2019;t seizing. Onstage they revived, and in Paris I danced the best swan queen of my career.<br> <br>I remember little of Paris. Ordinarily on trips to Paris I went to museums and caf�s, I bought out the shops of gloves and perfume, but that year I stayed in and rested. This time Paris was a mission, saving myself, compressing myself into dancing well, showing George, proving that I could go on regardless of our future as a couple, and proving to myself that I wasn&#x2019;t sick.<br> <br>At night I lay in the bath then slid into bed and unconsciousness easily, dimly aware for a minute or two of George quietly moving about the room so he wouldn&#x2019;t disturb me.<br> <br>On the morning we disembarked from Cologne, I discovered that I hadn&#x2019;t brought enough of the powdered dextrose many of us used in those days. I was riveted by the conviction that I couldn&#x2019;t dance without it. I asked girls on the train and nobody had any. Mother hadn&#x2019;t brought any extra, and as my options gave out I turned desperate. George claimed a cup of coffee would work equally well, that we girls were basically taking, &#x201c;What they call? Placebo. The kick&#x2019;s in your heads.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>I&#x2019;m finished,</i> I thought.<br> <br>Arriving in Scandinavia, clammy in my coat, mittens, and hat, I thought, just get through Copenhagen, Stockholm. . . . Mother and George believed I felt a cold coming on, and with each day Stravinsky remained on the planet George acted more chipper.<br> <br>We finished unpacking in our room with the brocaded wallpaper, in Copenhagen, before going over to the theater for a run-through.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you pray for Igor?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>George sniffed, unsure it wasn&#x2019;t a mock.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, did I pray? I always pray.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean especially hard?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Since when you take interest in religion?&#x201d; and he picked up his keys and said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go. I&#x2019;ll let you out fast, you can come back and rest.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sat on the horsehair mattress smelling of straw. &#x201c;Do you pray in Russian?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Mandarin.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tried to laugh, but it hurt my chest. I said, &#x201c;Tell me a prayer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, I will on the way over.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In Russian,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Shoving me through the door, he said, &#x201c;Sure, Russian.&#x201d;<br> <br>A car waited for us downstairs and we rode to the theater with Diana and another dancer, who hopped down the sidewalk in the cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Diana!&#x201d; George called. &#x201c;Yvonne!&#x201d; I watched, a fist in my throat, as he greeted them&#x2014;beautiful, long, dark-haired Diana, and equally dark and beautiful, voluptuous Yvonne.<br> <br>The Royal Opera House was magnificent, red velvet and gilt, carvings and soaring arches, a cathedral of art. George was ballet master there in his youth for a season. But, wed to the past, the Danes didn&#x2019;t want his ballets. George said Denmark grew the most beautiful women in the world like grass, but so what? They didn&#x2019;t <i>make</i> anything of them. Since George had become such a star, the Danes had invited him back. He brought us and quietly gloated.<br> <br>He let me go after only an hour&#x2019;s rehearsal, saying I was out of <i>Bourr�e Fantasque</i> for tomorrow. I would dance only one ballet for the opening and conserve my forces.<br> <br>Outside the theater I did not hail a cab, I ducked away from King&#x2019;s Plaza, dodging a streetcar that surged through teeming people on bikes, and set out along smaller streets, searching for dextrose. Ludicrous, because how would I ask for it? Where would it be? I had decided, however, that it would save me.<br> <br>Copenhagen was handsome, rather like Prague. Because of dark autumns and winters, from four o&#x2019;clock on candles flickered in banks and office buildings. In the lobby of our hotel you could barely walk for the pots of rust-colored and violet mums chockablock on the marble floor. Mother had threatened to steal one of the filigreed sterling sconces. Interiors in the north, George said, were everything.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t feel cold anymore. I smelled the sea. I thought of finding the Tivoli Gardens, but then I remembered they were closed. I knew Mother would worry if I didn&#x2019;t head back to the hotel soon, and I was reminded of stories George told me about the mother of Tamara Toumanova, his first very young star, his &#x201c;baby ballerina.&#x201d; Mama Toumanova wore each new pair of Tamara&#x2019;s slippers herself, tromping about, softening them so her daughter wouldn&#x2019;t get hurt. Mama stood in the wings and called, &#x201c;<i>Four</i> pirouettes, Tamara!&#x201d; Yes, my mother, Edith, came on tour with us far too often and watched every one of my performances, but she wasn&#x2019;t <i>that</i> bad. She even laughed at the sign on the dressing room door of the corps in New York at City Center, NO MOTHERS ALLOWED.<br> <br>Damn, Tamara could dance. She could balance forever. George made the role I was now dancing in <i>Symphony in C</i> on Tamara, and I&#x2019;d heard that at the difficult balance where the cavalier circles her in the grand tour, Tamara would let go of his hand. You had to <i>knock</i> her off pointe. I had yet to let go of the man&#x2019;s hand, though I didn&#x2019;t clamp on to it anymore.<br> <br>It was pleasant out walking alone with nobody watching me, nobody asking how I felt. Strangers passed on the sidewalks and laughed inside yellow squares. Soon candles were lit. At caf�s people sat outside wrapped in blankets, warmed by long metal heaters. I began to see stars.<br> <br>There was a statue of the Little Mermaid nearby, perched on a rock by the water. I wished I could find her. Then I recalled that Hans Christian Andersen chopped out her tongue, as if the tail were not bad enough.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t see one single drugstore or grocery. You&#x2019;d think in a large international city <i>somebody</i> might have a bag of corn sugar. Fatigue overtook me. I&#x2019;d come to a park in a square and sat down on a bench. Cars, clusters of bicycles passed rapidly. I knew to go back, go to bed. But I watched the stars. I liked being out in the open air, free. I felt momentarily very good in my good old body. I could start over. I could do anything. I was twenty-seven years old.<br> <br>The Danes saved their Jews. Thinking this churned my emotions, and I pictured the bombed buildings of Florence, the one bridge left spanning the River Arno&#x2014;what was it? The Ponte Vecchio. What year had it been? 1952. Then I thought of my father, who was connected in a way I wanted to grasp to the problem between George and me. It wasn&#x2019;t just that Mother and Father were separated. My father was a distinguished man, a scholar and a poet. George was as fascinated by him in the beginning as he had been by Maria&#x2019;s father, who was marginally an American Indian chief. Father told George about Mallarm� speaking of a dancer as &#x201c;writing with her body.&#x201d;<br> <br>I always liked dancing, but I was also always a bit of a lazy thing. Poor Father coped surprisingly well with my laziness, my lack of ambition in school: &#x201c;What are you doing, Tanaquil?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; slouched on the couch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing will come of nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So true.&#x201d; What a brat, and Papa smiled mildly, continuing into his study. Despite his restraint, a father who named his daughter for an Etruscan queen had a few expectations.<br> <br>When the dancing caught, he said, &#x201c;Fine. Just do it well.&#x201d; Mother was apoplectic with joy. In Mother&#x2019;s St. Louis, becoming a ballerina wasn&#x2019;t done. She read widely, traveled, married a glamorous Frenchman, and times changed.<br> <br>There is a photograph of me at eleven months in Cannes, before we moved to New York. I&#x2019;m holding on to a grille at the side of our building <i>en pointe</i>. Not technically, of course, but I&#x2019;m already at the barre.<br> <br>We were a family whose problem was we didn&#x2019;t talk. Or I should say, our words were games, bilingual tennis matches. For us words themselves were too potent to trust as conveyors of emotion, of need, as if words taken seriously could kill or enslave. In fact, and this was the irony, words were everything for Father. As he and Mother drifted apart, while Mother got more involved with me, Father increasingly shut himself up in his study with liquor and books.<br> <br>One night I dashed in distraught over a failed rehearsal and Father opened the study door, wafting brandy, eyes crimson in his narrow face. Swaying, but ever charming, he bashfully smiled and said, &#x201c;<i>Ma ch�re,</i> I finished my translation of Villon tonight.&#x201d; Fran�ois Villon, poet-thief of Father&#x2019;s cherished French medieval literature, though I&#x2019;d had not an inkling of the project. We should have celebrated, with tea or cocoa at that juncture, yes. He could have read me a poem, I could have confided in him about my rehearsal&#x2014;except Mother was finished with him. I copied her behavior, and nothing of this was discussed. The actual separation took years. I was a kid; I don&#x2019;t blame Mother. Some women prefer kids to men and some want men forever and the kids are a big interference, and there are other gradations, such as how personalities mesh and so on. But inside, Father and I were alike, much more than Mother and I.<br> <br>I wished in Copenhagen, face to the stars, that I hadn&#x2019;t said, &#x201c;Swell!&#x201d; and hurried to my room. I wished I hadn&#x2019;t been schooled to be light and gay and afraid of the passion in Father and in me. I wished George hadn&#x2019;t fallen for me because I was funny and bright and long-legged and that, from the first, we had talked about more than dancing. I wished I had seen him more, seen Father more. <i>Been</i> more.<br> <br>I wondered if Mother&#x2019;s coming along this year on tour had spoiled the chance of a remedy, a renewal. I worried she served as a buffer between George and me, enabling him to do whatever he wanted with minimal questions and complications.<br> <br>But as Mother herself might have said, how much could one affect, control? Father lived through written words as George lived through dancers&#x2019; bodies, and Father loved drink, and George got messed up as a kid in Russia eating cats off the street and replacing his absent family with music and girls.<br> <br>The chill jarred me, the intricate scrollwork on a lamppost, the pristine condition of the park, its design, and the exoticism of the language I could hear snapped me back to my senses and I dropped the idea of the dextrose.<br> <br>I stood like the Etruscan queen I was named for and hailed the gleaming black coach coming toward me. I deserved to be a queen, I thought, because I worked hard as a miner.<br> <br>It had proved bracing, lingering outside alone, on my last walk through a city forever.<br> <br>In the morning I awoke with a cold. Friday went swimmingly. George called music the water and us the fish. In his vernacular I could be angelfish, catfish, swordfish, or crab cake on a bad day. In another vein, my legs were columns, wands, whips, scissors, coltlike, needle-sharp, arrows, garrotes, and once, in an embarrassing class, he said, &#x201c;Asparagus. Cooked asparagus.&#x201d; Oh, the trials of learning to dance.<br> <br>He checked on me as I lay in the bath on Friday after the opening-night performance and gala. In relief, or out of hysteria, I tried to get him to kiss me, but he wouldn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rudolph red nose, I&#x2019;m not getting sick.&#x201d; His eyes skimmed my breasts, though, afloat in the water, and I began to believe I could get him back. I wanted him back. I said a silent pagan prayer that Diana or whoever the hell it was would elope and grow huge with child overnight. That was the one-way ticket out of the Balanchine kingdom.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t desire a child, being fully aware of George&#x2019;s feelings on the subject. Other relationships of his had ended over &#x201c;the baby question,&#x201d; and anyway, having been in physical training since the age of seven, my plans for my postdancing life did <i>not</i> include labor. I thought I might lie around for a couple years and then play Joan of Arc on the stage and star in a sexy film with Sinatra.<br> <br>There was the slightest heaviness in my left thigh. I lifted it from the water, testing. Champagne? The single glass I&#x2019;d had at the party?<br> <br>Back in the room, steam clung to the brocaded wallpaper, making the walls look swollen.<br> <br>My thigh had this hitch, getting in bed.<br> <br>Some said it took so long to become evident because I was strong. Others said the severity of my case resulted from my exertion during the incubation period.

The scene is Miami. In ritzy Coconut Grove, the teen son of Eliot, a newsman turned adman, sneaks up to spritz a cute girl with a Squirtmaster 9000 to win a high school game called Killer. Meanwhile, two hit men sneak up to kill the girl's abusive stepdad, Arthur.

With India passing by his window, he reflects on his destination, which is also his past: a military camp to which he has not returned for fourteen years. Kirpal, called Kip, is shy and not yet twenty when he arrives for the first time at General Kumar&#39;s camp, nestled in the shadow of the Siachen Glacier. At twenty thousand feet, the glacier makes a forbidding battlefield; its crevasses claimed the body of Kip&#39;s father. Kip becomes an apprentice under the camp&#39;s chef, Kishen, a fiery mentor who guides him toward the heady spheres of food and women. In this place of contradictions, erratic violence, and extreme temperatures, Kip learns to prepare local dishes and delicacies from around the globe.

Born in Punjab and brought up in Kashmir, Singh now lives in British Columbia.</p><b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>For a long time now I have stayed away from certain people.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was late getting to the station and almost missed the <i>Express </i>because of the American President. His motorcade was passing the Red Fort, not far from the railway terminal. The President is visiting India to sign the nuclear deal. He is staying at the Hotel Taj and the chefs at the hotel have invented a new kebab in his honor. All this in today&#x2019;s paper. Rarely does one see the photo of a kebab on the front page. It made my mouth water.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not far from me, a little girl is sitting on the aisle seat. A peach glows in her hand. Moments ago she asked her mother, What do we miss the most when we die? And I almost responded. But her mother put a thick finger on her lips: Shh, children should not talk about death, and she looked at me for a brief second, apologetically. Food, I almost said to the girl. We miss peaches, strawberries, delicacies like Sandhurst curry, kebab pasanda and rogan josh. The dead do not eat marzipan. The smell of bakeries torments them day and night.<br>&nbsp;<br>Something about this exchange between mother and daughter has upset me. I look out the window. The train is cutting through villages. I don&#x2019;t even know their names. But the swaying yellow mustard fields and the growing darkness fills me with disquiet about the time I resigned from the army. I find myself asking the same question over and over again. Why did I allow my life to take a wrong turn?<br>&nbsp;<br>Fourteen years ago I used to work as chef at the General&#x2019;s residence in Kashmir. I remember the fruit orchard by the kitchen window. For five straight years I cooked for him in that kitchen, then suddenly handed in my resignation and moved to Delhi. I never married. I cook for my mother. Now after a span of fourteen years I am returning to Kashmir.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is not that in all these years I was not tempted to return. The temptation was at times intense, especially when I heard about the quake and the rubble it left behind. But the earth shook mostly on the <i>enemy </i>side. During my five years of service I was confined to the Indian side &#x2013; the more beautiful side.<br>&nbsp;<br>The beauty is still embedded in my brain. It is the kind that cannot be shared with others. Most important things in our lives, like recipes, cannot be shared. They remain within us with a dash of this and a whiff of that and trouble our bones.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The tumor is in your brain, said the specialist. (Last week exactly at three o&#x2019;clock my CAT scan results came back to the clinic. The dark scan looked quite something inside that box of bright light.) His finger pointed towards an area which resembled a patch of snow, and next to it was a horrifying shape like the dark rings of a tree. Three months to a year maximum, he said. Suddenly I felt very weak and dizzy. My voice disintegrated. The world around me started withering.<br>&nbsp;<br>I walked the crowded street back home. Cutting through my own cloud, stepping through the fog. My mother greeted me at the door. She knew. My mother already knew. She (who cooked every meal for me when I was young) knew what I did not know myself. She handed me a letter, and slowly walked to her bed.<br>&nbsp;<br>The letter was postmarked Kashmir. After fourteen years General Sahib finally mailed the letter, and that thin piece of paper delighted me and brought tears to my eyes. His daughter is getting married. In hurriedly scribbled lines he requested me to be the chef for the wedding banquet.<br>&nbsp;<br>I read the letter a second time, sitting at the kitchen table. My answer was obviously going to be a no. I was not even planning to respond. I felt dizzy. But in the evening while preparing soup I changed my mind. I make all big decisions while cooking. Mother is bedridden most of the time and I served as usual in her room at eight in the evening. I did not reveal the trouble brewing in my brain. During dinner I simply read her the General&#x2019;s letter.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Are you sure?&#x2019; she asked. &#x2018;You want to go?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Of course,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;It is impossible to say no.&#x2019;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Dear Kip, Several times in the past I thought of writing to you, but I did not. You know me well, my whole life in the army has been geared to eliminate what is from a practical stand point non-essential.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>My daughter (whom you last saw as a child) is getting married, and she is the one who forced me to write this letter. I have heard that your mother is sick, but this is a very important event in our life, and we would like you to be the chef at the wedding. I do not want some new duffer to spoil it.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>You are the man for this emergency. I want to see you and I am tired and have much to talk over and plan with you. This wedding feast is perhaps my last battle and I would like for us to win it. I am sure you will not disappoint me.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Yours affectionately,</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Lt. General Ashwini Kumar (Retired), VrC, AVSM, PVSM.</i><br><i>Former GOC-in-C, Northern Command.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The General&#x2019;s daughter used to call me &#x2018;Kip-Ing&#x2019; (instead of Kirpal Singh). Since then &#x2018;Kip&#x2019; has stuck. In the army everyone has a second name. General Sahib&#x2019;s nickname was &#x2018;Red&#x2019;, but it was rarely mentioned in his presence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;How many days will you spend there?&#x2019; Mother asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Seven,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Seven or eight days. I must go, Mother. The neighbor will take care of you. Eating someone else&#x2019;s food will do you good.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mother did not finish the dal soup. Her frail head rested on two white pillows and she held my arm as if we were not going to see each other again.<br>&nbsp;<br>I urged her to take the yellow tablets and capsules. She agreed only after I raised my voice. I rarely raise my voice in the presence of Mother. Something inside me was definitely changing.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was then I showed her the wedding card:<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Rubiya Kumar</i><br>weds<br><i>Shahid Lone</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;So the General&#x2019;s daughter has decided to marry a Muslim?&#x2019; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Not just a Muslim,&#x2019; I added, &#x2018;but one from the other side of the border.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me put this straight. Sahib is not prejudiced against the Muslims. There were Muslim soldiers in our regiment, and he never once discriminated against any of them to my knowledge. But, of course, General Sahib is not pleased with the wedding. I have read the letter twice, and I sense his hands must have been shaking when he held the pen. Sahib gave his youth to our nation to keep the Pakistanis away, he fought two wars, and now his own daughter is marrying one of them. Did so many soldiers lose their lives for one big nothing?<br>&nbsp;<br>This train is moving slower than a mountain mule. The engine is old, I know. It resembles me in many ways. But the railway-wallahs insist on calling it an <i>Express</i>. I readjust my glasses, and my gaze drifts from one fuzzy face to another. They will last longer than me &#x2013; the ears and eyes and noses of other people. Faint scent of pickles fills the compartment. Loud and hazy conversations. Flies have started hovering over the little girl&#x2019;s peach.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once I prepare the perfect wedding banquet, General Sahib will refer me to top specialists in the military hospital, and they will start treatment right away. I have a high regard for military doctors. For my mother&#x2019;s sake, I must live a little longer. I don&#x2019;t know why I raised my voice in her presence. She needs me more than ever.

She lives in New York City with her husband.<p>In her exhaustively researched novel Scottsboro, Ellen Feldman errs on the side of too much history. The book painstakingly recreates the infamous Scottsboro case, complete with all the twists and turns and society-exposing foibles. But, ironically, what it fails to do is make either the real or fictional characters come to life.</p><p>The Scottsboro Boys, as they were called, were nine black teens accused of gang-raping two white women on the Southern Railroad freight run to Memphis on March 25, 1931. Feldman tells their tale through Alice Whittier, a fictional, left-leaning white journalist for a socialist newspaper in New York.</p><p>Alice searches out one of the accusing women, a dirt-poor millworker named Ruby Bates. In real life, as in the book, Bates later recanted her accusations and traveled the country raising money for the teens' defense. </p><p>The heart of the novel should be the complex, evolving relationship between these women from very different worlds. But Ruby is just too simple -- or too simply depicted -- to carry the emotional weight of the book, while Alice is too busy dispensing facts about 1930s America to blossom as a character. Her motivations for pursuing Bates are touched upon only lightly, as are her feelings about events both political and personal, including whether or not to sleep with her boss.</p><p>Trying to pack so many stories into a relatively short novel means a few end up flattened. In one chapter, for instance, we hear from the mother of one of the accused teens. Hers is a tale of birthing babies and picking cotton, of submitting to rape by the white boss to keep him off her daughters and staying down on her knees in hopes of better times. It's not that these terrible things weren't realities for black women in 1930s Alabama, but piling them all onto Mrs. Norris makes her feel less like a real person than a racial representative.</p><p>Scottsboro rightfully seeks to remind Americans of a shameful moment in our history. Sometimes, though, history should be delivered straight.</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Full-color photographs and step-by-step diagrams are included for each project. In addition, attractive and informational sidebars about the Earth's resources often appear. The book is adequately indexed and contains a metric-conversion table. Although the table of contents notes which projects require adult assistance, some that call for the use of potentially dangerous tools do not contain supervisory notes. Some of the materials listed are not readily available. Two of the activities require pressed ferns or flowers but don't indicate how to press or where to purchase them. The introduction and tips seem to be aimed at young children, yet many of the projects demand patience and dexterity. Urban youngsters will find the hunt for materials frustrating.

Just another season-by-season nature-craft book you say? Not so; in fact, there are some really great projects here that you'd be hard put to find instructions for elsewhere--such as producing your own decorative bricks, weaving a twig hat, and making fish-print T-shirts with real dead fish. Some are quite simple, but many require patience and dexterity, with a few demanding experience with saws and drills (these authors aren't as conscientious about coding projects for danger as some are). The step-by-step instructions are usually clear, but the illustrations (mostly photos) that accompany them are sometimes too small to give handicrafters a clear view of procedural details. Still, the project selection (there are 50) is intriguing and nicely varied, and discussions of different aspects of nature scattered through the text constantly remind readers of the connection between undisturbed, expansive, fascinating nature and what they can create with their own hands. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball</h2><p><b>Included in <i>Backchannel&#x2019;s</i> (WIRED.com) Top Tech Books of 2017&#x201d;</b><b><br><br>An important&#x201d; book on the pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics.&#x201d;<br> <strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>How the titans of tech's embrace of economic disruption and a rampant libertarian ideology is fracturing America and making it a meaner place </b><br><br>In <em>The Know-It-Alls</em> former <em>New York Times</em> technology columnist Noam Cohen chronicles the rise of Silicon Valley as a political and intellectual force in American life. Beginning nearly a century ago and showcasing the role of Stanford University as the incubator of this new class of super geeks, Cohen shows how smart guys like Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg fell in love with a radically individualistic ideal and then mainstreamed it. With these very rich men leading the way, unions, libraries, public schools, common courtesy, and even government itself have been pushed aside to make way for supposedly efficient market-based encounters via the Internet.<br><br>Donald Trump&#x2019;s election victory was an inadvertent triumph of the "disruption" that Silicon Valley has been pushing: Facebook and Twitter, eager to entertain their users, turned a blind eye to the fake news and the hateful ideas proliferating there. The Rust Belt states that shifted to Trump are the ones being left behind by a "meritocratic" Silicon Valley ideology that promotes an economy where, in the words of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, each of us is our own start-up. A society that belittles civility, empathy, and collaboration can easily be led astray. <em>The Know-It-Alls</em> explains how these self-proclaimed geniuses failed this most important test of democracy. <br></p><p><strong>Noam Cohen</strong> covered the influence of the Internet on the larger culture for the <em>New York Times</em>, where he wrote the Link by Link column, beginning in 2007.

It is extremely current, including entries on such recent topics as the Recruit political scandal and current prime minister Kaifu Toshiki. While the articles in the Kodansha Encyclopedia are written by experts in the field and provide bibliographic references with nearly all of the entries, the present work is authored entirely by Perkins, whom the publisher identifies as "an educator specializing in Buddhism and Japanese culture," and has only a general bibliography at the end. For its more comprehensive treatment, especially of historical topics and traditional culture, the Kodansha remains a standard source, but for its currency and value as a ready reference tool the Perkins volume will be a useful acquisition for most libraries as well.

After a brief, unexpected meeting with his doppelg�nger, perhaps the book's most original if overly enigmatic figure, Thomas Rhymer strides down the Great Road to discover a world "where everything's in harmony." In a series of mild adventures, Rhymer encounters scoundrels, liars, villains and even an upside-down castle. The action picks up a bit when he comes across the scrumptious tidbit Mab, Queen of Faerie, whom he later catches reading<i> Candide</i>.

Far from his native Montana, he has flown east at the invitation of a fellow from the Smithsonian who admires Du Pre's fiddle playing and his Metis Indian heritage. Plus, the gig pays five hundred and expenses.<br>Du Pre's much-prized native instincts come in handy when a runaway horse disrupts the festival - but then he finds himself being questioned by police, for the horse belonged to a young Cree woman from Canada who has been found murdered. To complicate matters, the Smithsonian man, Paul Chase, asks Du Pre to record some of his old voyageur ballads for the museum's archives. Du Pre returns to Montana feeling that he has left behind unfinished business and has sold a precious part of himself.<br>Thankfully, Du Pre finds Montana unchanged and his lover, Madelaine, anxious to make up for lost time. But then Paul Chase calls again: Will Du Pre join him and a group of others on a canoe trip through Canada, following a portion of the old fur-trade route where the voyageurs sang their songs? The prospect of an authentic wilderness experience holds little appeal, but Du Pre figures he may learn something, and so agrees. What he discovers on the trip - about Chase, his companions, and himself - leads Du Pre on a Journey through history and native myth, toward the truth about a murderer.</p><p>Peter Bowen (b. 1945) is an author best known for mystery novels set in the modern American West. When he was ten, Bowen&#x2019;s family moved to Bozeman, Montana, where a paper route introduced him to the grizzled old cowboys who frequented a bar called The Oaks. Listening to their stories, some of which stretched back to the 1870s, Bowen found inspiration for his later fiction.&nbsp;Following time at the University of Michigan and the University of Montana, Bowen published his first novel, <i>Yellowstone Kelly</i>, in 1987. After two more novels featuring the real-life Western hero, Bowen published <i>Coyote Wind</i> (1994), which introduced Gabriel Du Pr�, a mixed-race lawman living in fictional Toussaint, Montana. Bowen has written fourteen novels in the series, in which Du Pr� gets tangled up in everything from cold-blooded murder to the hunt for rare fossils. Bowen continues to live and write in Livingston, Montana.<br>Bowen sustains interest in this follow-up to Coyote Wind despite the lack of a believable suspect, discernible clues or a precise sense of place. He relies on his unusual protagonist, Gabriel Du Pre, a laconic rancher, fiddle player and self-mocking, part Native American freethinker given to abstract utterances. Lured from his native Montana to perform in a Washington, D.C., music festival, Du Pre is fiddling when a young Indian woman dies, the first of several murders that occur in his trail. Each is committed with a primitive weapon; all are foretold by a shaman; in the vicinity, each time, is psychotic rich man and artistic hanger-on, Paul Chase. Yet all Du Pre can do is wait for the shaman's next warning and follow his best hunches: that the killer's motive is pleasure, that Chase is being used for cover and that Du Pre is the killer's real focus. It's often hard to locate Du Pre as he is seen, variously, navigating a Canadian river, drinking with his lover Madelaine and playing with his grandchildren. But Bowen's prose is often droll and his characters well-etched; only clue seekers are in for a lean time here. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>X Pose: Photographs By Peter Jirmann Jr</h2><p>Acclaimed photographer Peter Jirmann&#x2019;s focus is the female nude but his pictures reveal as much about emotion and personality as they do the contours and surfaces of the human body.

Paris. It&#39;s the eve of the French presidential elections - &#39;The Election of the Century&#39; say the newspaper headlines - and Chaouch, the nation&#39;s first Arab candidate, has victory in his sights. It has been a long campaign, and with his wife Esther and daughter Jasmine by his side, he spends the remaining hours with close advisors in a hotel in Nimes. Much of the dinner table chatter revolves around Jasmine&#39;s boyfriend; Fouad Nerrouche, a well-known actor with the same Algerian origins as her father, who has just publicly endorsed Chaouch&#39;s candidacy. However shallow it may seem, it&#39;s difficult to ignore the influence of celebrity support in this complex and unpredictable race . . . The same day. Saint-Etienne. The Nerrouche family is frantically preparing for a grand wedding, and Fouad himself is there to help out. But younger cousin Krim - who has recently lost his job - is becoming increasingly agitated, and no one knows why. As the day goes on, it becomes clear that the cousin&#39;s problems go far deeper than unemployment. Krim has been stealing from a local gang leader and after being discovered, found himself indebted to his powerful cousin, Nazir - Fouad&#39;s brother. Nazir is a very shady figure, and is heavily involved in a dark underworld of crime. Together, their plans will cause Fouad&#39;s two very different worlds to meet in a way no one would have dared to imagine. Within a few hours, the threads start to unravel, and the collision between the destiny of a family and the hopes of a country becomes inevitable. With the pacing of a thriller, Louatah melds the tense atmosphere of a family saga with the gripping suspense of a political drama into one breathtaking read.</p><p>SABRI LOUATAH was born in France and now lives in Philadelphia. In 2005, while riots were breaking out across France, he read Demons by Dostoyevsky, and was inspired to write this series. Savages: The Wedding is his first novel.Immense, and immensely popular. * Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker * A compelling and expansive socio-political thriller. The Savages is a refreshing, if bleak, corrective to the romanticized images of France. In its readability The Savages evokes the nineteenth-century feuilleton, but its pace is best described as &#34;televisual,&#34; reflecting a tightly coiled American television series such as The Wire. Fans of the French Canal+/BBC collaboration Spiral will appreciate its blend of urban grit, cliffhangers and scrutiny of the French justice system. * The Times Literary Supplement * An exceptional political and social thiller. The energy and imagination behind The Savages are breathtaking. Like Zadie Smith, Sabri Louatah&#39;s ear is exceptional... * Liberation * Ferrante. Knausgaard. Louatah. Three literary series that are better than anything. * Grazia France * Exhilarating, sharp-edged, and complex, this is a compelling hybrid of family saga and socio-political thriller. * the Guardian * This is not the first time that the scenario of a French Arab president has been in a French-language novel - this was also the conceit of Michel Houellebecq&#39;s Submission . . . Savages is, however, a far superior book, having more in common with the complex and crafted plotting of The Sopranos or The Wire than the arch, sarcasm of Houellebecq&#39;s dystopia. [Louatah] promises no happy ending to the tensions that still plague France , but the book manages to thrill and entertain, while never losing the sharp political edge that also makes it important. * The Observer * Non-Francophone readers will have to endure the agony associated with waiting for the next season to arrive. * The Glasgow Herald * It&#39;s an absorbing set-up, not least because Louatah brilliantly conveys the anarchy and chaos of a wedding party in which both sets of families consider the other beneath them * Irish Times * [It] gives us race, politics, culture and crime within a vast cast of interlinked characters living the kind of French-Arab lives we rarely read about. Immersive. * Sunday Times Crime Club * Louatah&#39;s exhilarating four-volume epic holds up a mirror to modern France. Funny, clever and brutal . . . he is a name to watch . . . addictive . . . We can hope that Savages isn&#39;t the last word he&#39;s got to say on France. * the Guardian *</p><h2>Healing Plants of the Rocky Mountains</h2><p>Award winning author and herbalist, Darcy Williamson, shares her thirty years of experience teaching the diverse uses of Rocky Mountain plants. <p><i>Healing Plants of the Rocky Mountains </i> represents thirty-one native species that have greatly contributed to Darcy's intimate knowledge of the plant world.

Following his recovery, he was transferred to a regiment in Virginia, and a year later he went to Charleston, where he was ordered by General Pierre G. T. Beauregard to create a pictorial record of the Confederate Army&#x2019;s defense of Charleston harbor. Chapman completed a series of 31 paintings of Charleston as well as many other Civil War-related pictures familiar to historians. In 1867 he wrote his memoirs of his days as a soldier, a record that contains vivid descriptions of camp life, his first taste of battle, and his weeks in Confederate hospitals.</p> <p>After the war, Chapman spent eighteen months in Mexico, becoming the first American artist to paint that country&#x2019;s landscape. He lived the remainder of his life in Europe, Mexico, and the United States.

Chapman&#39;s firsthand knowledge is evident in his work.

Now he makes it easy for the home cook to master a classic dish and then add innovative touches to make it even more tempting, in what he calls contemporary classics. In addition, he includes &#x201c;Second Day Dishes,&#x201d; a new and magical approach to leftovers. <br><br>Here is how it works: classic Eggs Benedict with Hash Brown Potatoes and Oven-Dried Tomatoes leads to Canadian Bacon and Onion Potato Cake with Poached Eggs and Spicy Tomato Salsa, which in turn leads to Bacon, Potato, and Eggs Strudel on the second day. Traditional Broiled Shrimp with Scampi Butter and Tomato-Rice Pilaf is transformed into Saut�ed Shrimp with Spinach-Lasagna Roll and Crisp Spinach, and then into Shrimp Fried Rice and Sausage the next day.<br><br>A Classic Chef&#x2019;s Salad Bowl can be turned into Carpaccio of Chef&#x2019;s Salad, and then Chef&#x2019;s Salad Bruschetta. Roast Chicken &#x201c;Farmhouse Style&#x201d; with Potatoes, Mushrooms, Bacon, Onions, and Apple Cider Gravy is reconceived as Seawater-Soaked Chicken with Thyme and Poppy Seed Gnocchi, and a day later can become Chicken-Potato Pancakes with Apple-Sour Cream Sauce. New York Cheesecake becomes Grand Marnier Souffl�s, changed on the next day into Coconut Cheesecake Beignets with Red Fruit Sorbet and Berries. From appetizers to desserts, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner&#x2014;117 delectable recipes (including Titanic French Toast with Three Jams; Oh, My Cod!; Chocolate Chip UFOs; and many more of Burke&#x2019;s signature whimsical creations)&#x2014;a fabulous cookbook.<br></p></p><p>David Burke<b> </b>is the coauthor, with Carmel Berman Reingold, of <i>Cooking with David Burke. </i>He is<b> </b>a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, was trained in France, and was the first American to be awarded the prestigious Meilleurs Ouvriers de France Diplome d&#x2019;Honneur.

It&#x2019;s fun to watch the circles turn golden brown as they float around the top of the pan. A speedy flip, and in minutes a golden-brown and tender, warm doughnut is yours. A fast drain on paper towels and a quick toss in cinnamon-sugar, and you have the perfect accompaniment to a steaming cup of coffee or tea or a cold glass of milk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for rolling</p><p>1 tablespoon baking powder</p><p>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p><p>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</p><p>3 1/2 cups sugar</p><p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</p><p>3 large eggs, beaten</p><p>1/2 cup milk</p><p>Approximately 6 cups peanut oil</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combine the flour, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combine the cinnamon with 2 cups of the sugar in a resealable plastic bag. Set aside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Place the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer and begin beating. Add the remaining sugar and continue beating until the mixture is well combined. Add the eggs and continue beating. When well incorporated, begin adding the reserved flour mixture, alternately with the milk. Beat until a soft dough forms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lightly flour a clean, flat surface. Transfer the dough to the floured surface and lightly sprinkle the top with additional flour. Either pat the dough down or gently roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Using a doughnut cutter (a round cutter with a removable disk in the center to create the hole) or a biscuit cutter (if you use a biscuit cutter, you will have to carefully hand cut the center holes), cut out circles, reserving the &#x201c;holes.&#x201d; Gather up any remaining dough along with the &#x201c;holes&#x201d; and, again, pat or roll out the dough and cut out circles. Don&#x2019;t discard any dough, as the bits and pieces of the leftover dough can be fried to make oddly shaped doughnuts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Place a thick layer of paper towels on a flat surface.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 360 degrees on a candy thermometer. Add the doughnuts, a few at a time, and fry, turning occasionally with a slotted spoon, until the doughnuts have risen and are golden brown. Using the slotted spoon, gently lift the doughnuts to the paper towels to drain for just a few seconds. Then, transfer the doughnuts to the cinnamon-sugar mixture in the plastic bag and gently toss to coat them well. Remove the doughnuts from the cinnamon-sugar mixture and place them on a serving platter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CONTEMPORARY</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Drunken Fortune Doughnuts </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Makes about 2 1/2 dozen</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This might be called the hardworking man&#x2019;s version ofthe classic New Orleans breakfast of warm beignets and caf� au lait. In the &#x201c;Big Easy,&#x201d; beignets are not just consumed at breakfast but are also indulged throughout the day, coated in confectioners&#x2019; sugar, piping hot, and puffy. Made from a rich choux paste, the New Orleans classic is crisper than my filled, raised doughnut, which I first created as a steak house dessert.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drunken doughnuts, especially with the hidden fortune, are fun, rich, sweet, and intoxicating. When serving children, obviously you should omit the liqueur flavoring, but never the fortunes. When making the fortunes, try to re-create the look ofthe paper fortunes found in Chinese fortune cookies, and have fun with what you write.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 1/2 cups fine-quality raspberry jam</p><p>1/4 cup framboise</p><p>1 cup warm water (about 120 degrees)</p><p>1 cup warm milk (about 120 degrees)</p><p>1 ounce yeast</p><p>2 large eggs, at room temperature</p><p>1/2 cup canola oil</p><p>2 pounds all-purpose flour</p><p>3/4 cups granulated sugar</p><p>2 teaspoons salt</p><p>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</p><p>1 teaspoon ground cloves</p><p>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p><p>Approximately 6 cups peanut oil</p><p>30 handmade paper fortunes, optional</p><p>Approximately 1 cup confectioners&#x2019;sugar</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combine the raspberry jam and frambroise in a small bowl, stirring to blend well. Set aside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combine the water, milk, and yeast in a large mixing bowl, stirring until the yeast has dissolved. Whisk in the eggs and oil until well combined. Using a wooden spoon, beat in 1 1/2 pounds of the flour. If the dough becomes too stiff to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands to knead the dough together. When the flour is well incorporated into the dough, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and place the dough in a warm spot to rest until doubled in size. This should take about 90 minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the dough is rising, mix the remaining flour with the granulated sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. When the dough has doubled in size, knead in the spiced flour mixture, kneading until the mixture is smooth. Place into a large, clean bowl and again place in a warm spot to rest until doubled in size.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lightly flour a clean, flat surface. Pat the dough out on the floured surface. Sprinkle the top with additional flour and gently roll out the dough to a thickness ofabout 1/2-inch. Using a biscuit cutter, cut out circles until you have used all ofthe dough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 360 degrees on a candy thermometer. Add the doughnuts, a few at a time, and fry, turning occasionally with a slotted spoon, until the doughnuts have risen to the top and are golden. Transfer them to wire racks to cool slightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When just cool enough to handle, using a small, sharp knife, cut a small opening in one side ofeach doughnut and a tiny opening in the opposite side. Using a teaspoon, stuffa bit of the jam-liqueur mixture into the larger opening in each doughnut and tuck a fortune into the smaller opening. Place the doughnuts on a serving platter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Place the confectioners&#x2019; sugar in a fine sieve and, holding the sieve over the platter, tap gently against the edge ofthe sieve to dust the doughnuts. Serve immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>SECOND DAY DISH</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Stuffed Doughnuts with Whipped Cream and Berries</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serves 6</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a very simple and very delicious Second Day Dish. The cream and berries soak into the day-old doughnuts and create a fantastic dessert. I thought of the wonderful French dessert, Paris-Brest, when I created this easy sweet. Traditionally, a Paris-Brest is a baked ring ofalmond-crusted choux paste that is split and filled with a praline cream. Using yesterday&#x2019;s doughnuts and fragrant berries and sweet cream, this is a lot simpler to put together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 cup cold water</p><p>1 cup granulated sugar</p><p>1 cup heavy cream</p><p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p><p>1 cup blanched sliced almonds</p><p>6 day-old Simple Sugar-and-Spice Doughnuts (see page 26) or other plain doughnuts</p><p>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons confectioners&#x2019; sugar</p><p>1 pint raspberries</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combine the water and granulated sugar in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the simple syrup from the heat and allow it to cool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combine the cream and vanilla in a mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate the mixture until you are ready to use it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Place the almonds on a clean plate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using a bread knife, slice each doughnut in half crosswise. Dip both sides ofeach half into the cooled simple syrup to just dampen. Place the browned part ofthe top half into the almonds to coat evenly. Place the doughnut halves, split side down, on the prepared baking sheet and into the preheated oven, and bake for 12 minutes, or until the almonds are golden and the doughnuts are slightly crisp on the outside but warm and moist on the inside. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remove the chilled cream from the refrigerator and, using an electric mixer, beat for 1 minute. Add the 3 tablespoons ofconfectioners&#x2019; sugar and continue to beat until soft peaks form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Place the doughnut bottoms, split side up, on a flat surface. Using a spatula, generously coat each bottom with some ofthe whipped cream. Nestle some raspberries into the cream on each doughnut. Using the spatula, lightly coat the split side ofthe doughnut tops with whipped cream. Gently place the top half onto the bottom, almond-coated side up. Place each doughnut onto a dessert plate. Sprinkle some raspberries around the edge ofthe plate. Place the remaining 1/4 cup ofconfectioners&#x2019; sugar into a fine sieve and, holding the sieve over each plate, tap gently on the edge ofthe sieve to lightly dust the entire plate.

Guided by a powerful old warrior named Socrates, tempted by an elusive, playful woman named Joy, Dan is led toward a final confrontation that will deliver or destroy him. Join Dan as he learns to live as a peaceful warrior. <p>This international best-seller conveys piercing truths and humorous wisdom, speaking directly to the universal quest for happiness.</p></p><p>During his junior year at the University of California, Dan Millman first stumbled upon his mentor (nicknamed Socrates) at an all-night gas station. At the time, Millman hoped to become a world-champion gymnast. "To survive the lessons ahead, you're going to need far more energy than ever before," Socrates warned him that night. "You must cleanse your body of tension, free your mind of stagnant knowledge, and open your heart to the energy of true emotion." From there, the unpredictable Socrates proceeded to teach Millman the "way of the peaceful warrior." At first Socrates shattered every preconceived notion that Millman had about academics, athletics, and achievement. But eventually Millman stopped resisting the lessons, and began to try on a whole new ideology--one that valued being conscious over being smart, and strength in spirit over strength in body. Although the character of the cigarette-smoking Socrates seems like a fictional, modern-day Merlin, Millman asserts that he is based on an actual person. Certain male readers especially appreciate the coming-of-age theme, the haunting love story with the elusive woman Joy, and the challenging of Western beliefs about masculine power and success. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>To our readers: The books we publish are our contribution to an emerging world based on cooperation rather than on competition, on affirmation of the human spirit rather than on self-doubt, and on the certainty that all humanity is connected.

It&#x2019;s summer 1983 in a northern California suburb, and these working-class kids have been killing time the usual ways: ducking their parents, tinkering with their bikes, and racing around town getting high and boosting their neighbors&#x2019; meds. Just another typical summer break in the burbs. Till Andy&#x2019;s bike is stolen by the town&#x2019;s legendary petty hoods, the Arroyo brothers. When the boys break into the Arroyos&#x2019; place in search of the bike, they stumble across the brothers&#x2019; private industry: a crank lab. Being the kind of kids who rarely know better, they do what comes naturally: they take a stash of crank to sell for quick cash. But doing so they unleash hidden rivalries and crimes, and the dark and secret past of their town and their families.<br><br>The spreading stain is drawing local drug lords, crooked cops, hard-riding bikers, and the brutal history of the boys&#x2019; fathers in its wake.</p><p>Charlie Huston is the author of the Henry Thompson Trilogy: Caught Stealing, Six Bad Things (an Edgar Award-nominee), and A Dangerous Man, as well as the Joe Pitt novels: Already Dead and No Dominion.

You gotta be able to kick my ass.<br><br>George rubs the cement over the puncture.<br><br>Paul puts his other arm behind him.<br><br>&#x2014;No hands. No hands. It&#x2019;s never gonna get easier than this, man. C&#x2019;mon and take a shot. You know you want to. Remember that time I pantsed you on the quad? Here&#x2019;s your chance to get back at me.<br><br>Andy remembers. First day of his freshman year, bad enough that he&#x2019;d been skipped a year to start high school early, but there was Paul, greeting him by running up and yanking his hand me down bell bottoms to his ankles while the entire student body was crisscrossing the quad on their way to homeroom.<br><br>He pictures standing in the middle of that quad with a machine gun in his hands, pulling the trigger and turning in slow circles until he is all alone and it is quiet.<br><br>He shakes his head sharply, trying to jar the image loose. He fails.<br><br>He takes the cement back from George, caps it and drops it in the kit, chews the inside of his cheek.<br><br>Paul swings himself back and forth a few times.<br><br>&#x2014;What&#x2019;s the matter, spaz? Looks like you&#x2019;re getting twitchy over there. You gonna freak out and start throwing things again?<br><br>George picks up one of the rocks, cups it like a marble and flicks it at Paul, bouncing it off his forehead.<br><br>Paul laughs.<br><br>&#x2014;You&#x2019;re off the hook, Andy, your bro&#x2019;s fighting your battles again.<br><br>George sets the innertube aside, carefully draping it on the frame of his upside down bike. Andy hands him a large piece of patch and a small pair of scissors.<br><br>George clips a small square from the patch.<br><br>&#x2014;I ain&#x2019;t sticking up for the puss, dickhead. I&#x2019;m just sick of hearing your shit. Our dad&#x2019;s gonna unload on him tonight and I&#x2019;m gonna have to listen it.<br><br>George squares his shoulders and lowers his voice.<br><br>&#x2014;Opportunity, boys, that&#x2019;s what a thief looks for. Turn your back for a second, your property will be gone. Always lock up your bike. It&#x2019;s not just a toy, it&#x2019;s a responsibility.<br><br>Paul rubs the spot where the rock tagged him.<br><br>&#x2014;Whatever.<br><br>George peels away the bright blue backing from the patch, careful not to touch the sticky underside, and picks up the innertube. Pressing the patch over the hole, using his thumbs to smooth away any air bubbles trapped under it, he looks at Andy.<br><br>&#x2014;What&#x2019;re you gonna tell him?<br><br>Andy stares at the patch, the violence in his head finally fading as he draws blood from his cheek. Why does he have to think about that kind of shit? It&#x2019;s not like he&#x2019;s like Paul. Paul likes to fight. But fighting sucks. Getting punched sucks. And hurting someone else, that almost sucks worse.<br><br>George kicks him in the shin.<br><br>&#x2014;Dude, what are you gonna tell dad?<br><br>Andy shrugs.<br><br>&#x2014;Dunno.<br><br>Paul unclamps his legs and tumbles to the ground, bracing with his arms as he lands.<br><br>Andy flips him off.<br><br>&#x2014;Nice move, grace.<br><br>Paul doesn&#x2019;t move, just lays there with his eyes closed, his face suddenly pale and sweaty, skin drawn tight over his forehead.<br><br>George is focused on the tire and doesn&#x2019;t notice.<br><br>Andy does.<br><br>&#x2014;You OK?<br><br>Paul doesn&#x2019;t move, just breathes deeply.<br><br>Andy steps closer.<br><br>&#x2014;Migraine?<br><br>Paul opens his eyes, wipes the sweat from his face. He sits up slowly.<br><br>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m fucking fine. You&#x2019;re the one with problems.

In <b>The Parables of Joshua</b>, perhaps his most powerful book since the original <b>Joshua</b>, Girzone distills the essence of Christian teaching in entertaining and inspiring "bite-sized" tales set against the background of current society. <br><br>For some today, the parables of the New Testament are quaint, old-fashioned stories, with little relevance to everyday life in the twenty-first century. As Girzone writes in his Introduction, "I have heard the most callous people comment with such great piety on the parables that I could not help but wonder if we haven't made parables pleasant-sounding fables about human situations long past, but with no present-day meaning." In order to recapture their original vitality Girzone revives the timeless messages behind the original parables by "dressing them in modern clothes," presenting them through Joshua in a conversational style that will resonate with a modern audience.</p><p>Joseph F. Girzone<b> </b>retired from the active priesthood in 1981 for health reasons and embarked on a successful second career as a writer and international speaker. His bestselling books include <b>Joshua: The Homecoming, A Portrait of Jesus</b>, and <b>Never Alone</b>. In 1995 he established the Joshua Foundation, an organization dedicated to making Jesus better known throughout the world. He lives in Albany, New York.The Parable of the Wealthy Artist<br><br>ON ONE OCCASION, as Joshua was talking to a crowd that had gathered around him, a woman spoke up and bluntly asked him what he thought of the Church. Calm and unruffled, Joshua replied, "The kingdom of God is like a man who had great wealth and power. He controlled vast territories and whole populations throughout the world. His wealth was beyond measure and, indeed, seemed without limit. He was, however, not concerned with power, or even with his wealth. His joy was in creating living masterpieces of art and sculpture. But in spite of his great possessions, he was alone, and had no one with whom to share his joy. Disguising himself as an ordinary person, he sought out those with whom he could share his life. Dressed in plain clothes and living in a simple manner, he began his search. He approached those who appeared intelligent and wise in the things of the world. "Certainly these men and women will be friends with whom I can share my life," he said to himself, and he approached them.<br><br>"What does he want of us?" they asked themselves. They were suspicious and looked down on him as a person of no value or use to themselves, so they shunned him. Others he met were highly intelligent persons of science and possessed knowledge of many things. However, he soon found that they were enchanted with their own intelligence and saw no reason to allow this simple man into their lives. He would be a nuisance and could contribute nothing to their circle of learned colleagues. They too shunned him. Others were persons of great importance and had many friends in high places. He approached them, thinking they would, without doubt, appreciate his friendship, but they were ashamed even to be seen with him. They too shunned him.<br><br>"Discouraged by the shallow vision of all these intelligent people, the rich man decided to look among ordinary people. They were kind and friendly toward him and welcomed him into their friendship. Taking him into their homes, they shared with him their meager possessions and their simple food, and allowed him into their lives, without any question or concern about his status. However, even among these good people, some soon tired of him, and found excuses to avoid him. But to those who opened their hearts and allowed him to share in their friendship, he revealed his true identity and shared with them his life and the awesome world in which he lived. When the others saw what had happened, they were beside themselves with grief that with all their smug intelligence they had failed to perceive the greatness hidden beneath the stranger's simple manner. What they had searched for all their lives was nothing compared with the riches and the glory and power the rich man shared so freely with all those simple people. And that is the way it will be with those who, when the Savior comes knocking, see in him nothing of value, and so turn him away, and continue to walk in darkness."<br><br>The Parable of the Pilgrims' Guide<br><br>ON ANOTHER DAY as Joshua was standing on the shore of a great lake, he remarked to the small crowd that was with him, "The kingdom of heaven is like adventurers who wanted to cross a great sea. On the shore was a guide charged by his captain with the responsibility of directing pilgrims to their destination. He knew well the destination and the safest way to arrive there. After giving pilgrims careful instructions he warned them that the voyage was long and dangerous, and without proper guidance, they could become lost along the way. But they should not be afraid because the gentle breeze along the course would take them safely through dangerous waters and carry them to their destination. One man said to himself, 'I am strong and wise. I know the waters better than he. I can find my own way. Why should I trust a breeze to guide me? And, besides, I do not like the guide. I will follow my own directions.' So he, and others like him, took off in a boat of their own design. But after many days of toiling against adverse winds, and with no one to guide them, they became confused and exhausted, and gave up. There were others who followed after them. Most of them met with the same fate.<br><br>"Another group listened to the guide. They considered his words but were reluctant to follow his advice. 'We are afraid of the water. We cannot swim and, besides, it is too far for us to row. Why should we follow the guide's directions? We will walk around the sea.' So, they began walking. After many months, they became weary and exhausted and could no longer endure the hardship. Realizing it was impossible for them to reach their destination on their own strength, they too gave up.<br><br>"There were still others on the shore who listened to the guide and took his advice. They knew they could not row across such an impossible expanse of water without guidance and without support. They also realized that they could not survive the impossible walk around the sea. They decided to follow the guide's directions. Moored on the shore was a large sailboat, which the guide used on his own trips. He told the group they were welcome to use it. They were delighted.<br><br>"As they were about to leave, they asked others if they would like to come with them, as there was still room.<br><br>" 'No,' they replied, 'we will go on our own. We are all going to the same place. It makes no difference how we get there. We will meet you on the other side.'<br><br>"So, freeing the boat from its moorings, the group set sail and carefully followed the guide's directions, always letting themselves be guided by the gentle breeze in difficult times. Though the voyage was not easy, they never lost heart as they were gently guided through calm and difficult times.<br><br>"Finally they arrived at their destination. The most breathtaking vision unfolded before their eyes. It was a kingdom of magnificent splendor. As they emerged from the boat, they were greeted by the inhabitants, who were thrilled to see them. Immediately, a celebration was arranged at which they were formally welcomed. After many days, they looked for the others who left when they did, but they had not yet arrived."<br><br>"Would you explain the parable to us?" Joshua's friend Pat asked him.<br><br>"Yes," Joshua told him. "The great sea is the span of a person's life on earth. The destination is the kingdom of heaven after death. The captain is the Savior. The guide is the apostles Jesus left to teach his people. Those who rejected their guidance and decided to walk to their destination are those who knowingly reject the teachers Jesus sent and choose instead to follow their own lights. They soon become weary and confused and eventually lose their way. Those who disliked the guide and his instructions and followed a manual of their own are those who have rejected the guides whom the Savior has given them and, building boats of their own, follow guides of their own making. The sailboat is the Church, ever guided by the gentle breeze of the Holy Spirit, and in its understanding of God's Word, it will always be available to carry people safely to the kingdom of heaven."<br><br>Parables of the Kingdom<br><br>OR AGAIN, the path to the kingdom of heaven is like a majestic oceanliner carrying passengers to a faraway land. Many of the officers on the ship were good people. A few, however, were dishonorable. There were also on the ship righteous passengers who were offended by the behavior of the dishonorable crewmen and decided they would no longer travel with them. One night, when all were asleep, they unhitched the lifeboats and quietly slipped them into the ocean. Abandoning the ship, they attempted to make the long and treacherous voyage on their own. After drifting aimlessly for many days without provisions, some were fortunate to be rescued.<br><br>Or again, the kingdom of heaven is like a group of people lost in a jungle. For days and weeks they fought their way through heavy brush and impossible conditions, always fearful of poisonous snakes and wild animals. On the verge of despair, they one day encountered a wise man. They knew neither where he came from nor where he was going. Approaching him, they inquired if he could point for them the way to safety. The wise man thought and thought for the longest time, continually looking over the desperate group. He thought of telling the whole group the way out, but decided against it, realizing that if he told them all, each would understand his message in a different way, and they would end up arguing and fighting and perhaps killing one another. So the wise man decided to pick one person who was wise and concerned for the group, and shared with him alone the directions out of the jungle. Then, the wise man left to continue on his way in the opposite direction. For a while the group was happy to follow the leader whom the wise man had appointed, but as time passed, some became disgruntled and decided that they would rather find their own way through the jungle. So, they parted ways. Farther along the path, a few more decided they would follow their own lights. They also left and went their own way. Those who remained loyal to the leader ultimately found their way to safety, while the others wandered aimlessly through the jungle.<br><br>The Parable of the Unworthy Shepherd<br><br>ONE SUNDAY MORNING, in a small mountain village, Joshua and his friends were talking in front of church after services. Clergy were standing nearby listening to the conversation. Pat told Joshua of a friend who was deeply hurt because her pastor had told her she was not a good woman, that she was a sinner.<br><br>Joshua then told them a parable. "A woman had three little children. The man with whom she lived cared nothing for her and rarely came home. The woman asked her pastor to baptize her baby. He refused, saying she was not a good woman because she did not obey all the laws of the Church. Whenever she went to church, she begged the pastor to baptize her baby. He always refused, insisting that she first marry the man wi...</p><h2>The Parts Left Out: A Novel (Fiction / Poetry)</h2><p><i>The Parts Left Out</i> is a suspenseful story of a poor Kansas wheat-farming family in which each generation holds the next in its deadly grip until murderous opposition explodes. The beautifully drawn characters, all sympathetic in their own ways, are determined to escape the fate that has been dealt them, and some seem close to doing so.</p><p>Thomas H. Ogden published his debut novel, <i>The Parts Left Out</i>, in 2014. He has also published twelve books of essays on the theory and practice of psychoanalysis, and on the writings of Frost, Borges, Kafka, and others. His most recent works of non-fiction include <i>The Analyst&#x2019;s Ear and the Critic&#x2019;s Eye: Rethinking Psychoanalysis and Literature</i>; <i>Creative Readings: Essays on Seminal Analytic Works</i>; <i>Rediscovering Psychoanalysis</i>; and <i>This Art of Psychoanalysis: Dreaming Undreamt Dreams and Interrupted Cries</i>. His work has been translated into twenty languages. Dr. Ogden was awarded the 2012 Sigourney Award for his &#x201c;contributions to the field of psychoanalysis&#x201d;; the 2010 Haskell Norman Prize for &#x201c;outstanding achievement as a psychoanalytic clinician, teacher and theoretician&#x201d;; and the 2004 International Journal of Psychoanalysis Award for &#x201c;The Most Important Paper of the Year.&#x201d; He practices psychoanalysis in San Francisco, where he teaches both psychoanalysis and creative writing."Not only is [Thomas Ogden] the most creative psychoanalytic author writing today, but in this novel he shows himself to be a wonderful teller of tales. <i>The Parts Left Out</i> is an auspicious achievement. As a work of fiction it succeeds in accomplishing the most difficult of feats: to be both a spellbinder and an in-depth exploration of human traits that bring on unspeakable tragedy. Tom Ogden knows the human mind as few do. In The Parts Left Out he demonstrates his remarkable understanding not only of the mind, but of the human heart as well." (Theodore Jacobs <i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association</i> 2015-06-01)<br><br>"Ogden writes movingly and convincingly about everyday life, at the same time that he writes tragedy... The dialogue rings true psychologically, at the same time that it is unnerving... I do not find this a conventional novel in the sense of offering a smooth or consistent narrative, much less a single point of view. Rather it is jumpy, unsettling... but this is also, I believe, its strength." (Madelon Sprengnether, Regents Professor of English <i>in International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 2015, pp. 247-250</i> 2015-06-01)<br><br>"Thomas Ogden, who is perhaps the most renowned psychoanalyst writing today, demonstrates his prowess as a writer of fiction in his stunning debut novel, <i>The Parts Left Out</i>. His keen eye for the complexity of human relationships and human frailties makes the characters so real and compelling that they seem to step out of the page. Ogden&#x2019;s novel confirms that the truest concepts developed in psychoanalysis have already appeared in the insight of the artist. This story takes hold of the reader in its opening paragraphs and does not let go until its heart-wrenching ending has been told. I found this book almost impossible to put down."

With novelistic detail, Atkinson tells the story of West Point's Class of 1966 primarily through the experiences of three classmates and the women they loved--from the boisterous cadet years and youthful romances to the fires of Vietnam, where dozens of their classmates died and hundreds more grew disillusioned, to the hard peace and family adjustments that followed. The rich cast of characters includes Douglas MacArthur, William Westmoreland, and a score of other memorable figures. The West Point Class of 1966 straddled a fault line in American history, and Rick Atkinson's masterly book speaks for a generation of American men and women about innocence, patriotism, and the price we pay for our dreams.<br></p><p>Rick Atkinson, recipient of the 2010 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing, is the bestselling author of <i>The Day Of Battle, An Army at Dawn</i>, and <i>In the Company of Soldiers</i>. He was a staff writer and senior editor at <i>The Washington Post</i> for twenty years, and his many awards include Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and history. He lives in Washington, D.C.Since its founding by Thomas Jefferson in 1802, the United States Military Academy, "fortress of virtue, preserve of the nation's values," has exerted a powerful and lasting influence on its graduates. As revealed in this Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter's eloquent and heartfelt narrative, the class of 1966 was subjected to oral and ethical pressures that were unique, partly because it was "the first generation of West Pointers to join a losing Army," and partly because of the radical change in society's attitude toward the military during the latter years of the Vietnam era. Atkinson profiles a handful of representatives of that class, following them from their high-spirited cadet years, through the crucible of Southeast Asia and--of those who survived--into the hard peace that ensued. The book is a poignant, thought-provoking account of the struggles of young men who pledged themselves to "Honor, Duty, Country," but found that living up to West Point's iron standards was difficult and in some cases impossible. 100,000 first printing; $150,000 ad/promo; film rights to Warner Bros; author tour. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Murder of Rosa Luxemburg</h2><p><b>On the tracks of the killers of Rosa Luxemburg</b><br><br>The cold-blooded murder of revolutionary icons Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in the pitched political battles of post-WWI Germany marks one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century. No other political assassination inflamed popular passions and transformed Germany's political climate as that killing in the night of 15-16 January 1919 in front of the luxurious Hotel Eden. It not only cut short the lives of two of the country's most brilliant political leaders, but also inaugurated a series of further political assassinations designed to snuff out the revolutionary flame and, ultimately, pave the way for the ultra-reactionary forces that would take power in 1933. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of their untimely deaths, Klaus Gietinger has carefully reconstructed the events on that fateful night, digging deep into the archives to identify who exactly was responsible for the murder, and what forces in high-placed positions had a hand in facilitating it and protecting the culprits.</p><p><b>Klaus Gietinger</b> is a German screenwriter for a long-running TV cop show, film director and historian based in Frankfurt am Main.

Not in the day, you can&#x2019;t. Still, it kept the youngsters quiet, precariously balancing on the ship&#x2019;s rail while they looked for it. When travelling with children, always keep a little game in hand for those last troublesome moments at the end of a long journey. <p></p><p></p>We adults stood close by, wrapped up in cloaks against the breeze and ready to dive in if little Julia and Favonia accidentally plunged overboard. To add to our anxiety, we could see all the crew making urgent attempts to work out where we were as we approached the long, low, famously featureless coastline of Egypt, with its numerous shoals, currents, rocky outcrops, suddenly shifting winds and difficult lack of landmarks. We were passengers on a large cargo boat that was making its first lumbering trip south this season; indications were that over the winter everyone had forgotten how to do this journey. The dour captain was frantically taking soundings and looking for silt in seawater samples to tell him he was near the Nile. Since the Nile delta was absolutely enormous, I hoped he was not such a poor navigator he had missed it. Our sailing from Rhodes had not filled me with faith. I thought I could hear that salty old sea god Poseidon laughing. <p></p><p></p>Some Greek geographer&#x2019;s turgid memoirs had supplied oodles of misinformation to Helena Justina. My sceptical wife and tour-planner reckoned that even from this far out you could not only see the Lighthouse, shining like a big confusing star, but also smell the city wafting across the water. She swore she could. True or not, we two romantics convinced ourselves that exotic scents of lotus oil, rose petals, nard, Arabian balsam, bdellium and frankincense were greeting us over the warm ocean&#x2014;along with the other memorable odours of Alexandria, sweaty robes and overflowing sewage. Not to mention the occasional dead cow floating down the Nile. <p></p><p></p>As a Roman, my handsome nose detected this perfume&#x2019;s darkest under-notes. I knew my heritage. I came fully equipped with the old prejudice that anything to do with Egypt involved corruption and deceit. <p></p><p></p>I was right too. <p></p><p></p>At last we sailed safely through the treacherous shoals to what could only be the legendary city of Alexandria. The captain seemed relieved to have found it&#x2014;and perhaps surprised at his skilful steering. We pootled in under the enormous Lighthouse then he tried to find one empty space to moor amongst the thousands of vessels that lined the embankments of the Eastern Harbour. We had a pilot, but pointing out a spare stretch of quay was beneath him. He put himself off into a bumboat and left us to it. For a couple of hours our ship manoeuvred slowly up and down. At last we squeezed in, shaving the paint on two other vessels with the joggle-mooring method. <p></p><p></p>Helena and I like to think we are good travellers, but we are human. We were tired and tense. It had taken six days from Athens, via Rhodes, and an interminable time out from Rome before that. We had lodgings; we were to stay with my Uncle Fulvius and his live-in boyfriend&#x2014;but we did not know them well and were anxious about how we would find their house. In addition, Helena and I were well-read. We knew our history. So, as we faced up to disembarkation, I could not help joking about Pompey the Great: how he was collected from his trireme to go ashore to meet the King of Egypt&#x2014;and how he was stabbed in the back by a Roman soldier he knew, butchered with his wife and children watching, then beheaded. <p></p><p></p>My job involves weighing up risks, then taking them anyway. Despite Pompey, I was all set to lead the way bravely down the gangplank when Helena shoved me out of her way. <p></p><p></p>&#x2018;Oh don&#x2019;t be ridiculous, Falco. Nobody here wants your head&#x2014; yet. I&#x2019;ll go first!&#x2019; she said. <p></p><p></p>Excerpted from Alexandria by Lindsey Davis.Copyright � 2009 by Lindsey Davis.<br>Published by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press. <p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

The photographs from these journeys form one of the most extensive records of any region taken in the 19th century. The range, depth and aesthetic quality of John Thomson s photographic vision mark him out as one of the most important travel photographers.<br><br>At that time cameras were large and heavy. The photographic images were exposed onto a glass negative and this had to be done in complete darkness, on location, in a portable darkroom tent. Thomson travelled with a large number of cumbersome crates, glass negatives and highly flammable and poisonous chemicals. Given that his journeys took him through difficult terrain and insect-infested jungles, sometimes to regions where a white man had not been seen before, it is all the more remarkable that Thomson was able to make photographs of such beauty and sensitivity. During an era when his contemporaries took portraits in which their subjects looking stilted and wooden, Thomson managed to capture the individuality and humanity of the diverse people of Asia, whether royalty or street vendor.<br><br>In Siam, Thomson was able to photograph King Mongkut (Rama IV), his royal family and entourage. In Cambodia, Thomson was the first photographer to visit Angkor, to record what is now, one of the most important sites of ancient architecture in the world. These photographs form a unique archive of images documenting 19th century Asian landscapes, architecture, people and customs. The collection of over 600 glass plates traveled back with Thomson to Britain in 1872 and since 1921 has been housed and expertly preserved at the Wellcome Library, London.<br><br>The 150-year-old glass negatives are in excellent condition allowing the exhibition to showcase very large prints, some life-size. Altogether 43 photographs taken in Siam, six taken in Angkor and 15 from Southern China are displayed in this ground-breaking exhibition.</p><p></p><h2>Acceptable Loss (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic)</h2><p>&#34;When the body of a small-time crook named Mickey Parfitt washes up on the tide, no one grieves.

Reprint.</p><p><strong>Stephen King and Nelson DeMille on Ed McBain</strong><br><br> I think Evan Hunter, known by that name or as Ed McBain, was one of the most influential writers of the postwar generation. He was the first writer to successfully merge realism with genre fiction, and by so doing I think he may actually have created the kind of popular fiction that drove the best-seller lists and lit up the American imagination in the years 1960 to 2000. Books as disparate as <em>The New Centurions</em>, <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, <em>The Godfather</em>, <em>Black Sunday</em>, and <em>The Shining</em> all owe a debt to Evan Hunter, who taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture. He will be remembered for bringing the so-called "police procedural" into the modern age, but he did so much more than that. And he was one hell of a nice man. --<em>Stephen King<br><br></em>Way back in the mid-1970s, when I was a new writer and police series were very big, my editor asked me to do a series called <em>Joe Ryker, NYPD.</em> I had no idea how to write a police detective novel, but the editor handed me a stack of books and said, &#x201c;These are the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain. Read them and you&#x2019;ll know everything you need to know about police novels.&#x201d; After I read the first book--which I think was <em>Let&#x2019;s Hear It for the Deaf Man</em>--I was hooked, and I read every Ed McBain I could get my hands on. Then I sat down and wrote my own detective novel, <em>The Sniper</em>, featuring Joe Ryker. My series never reached the heights of the 87th Precinct series, but by reading those classic masterpieces, I learned all I needed to know about urban crime and how detectives think and act. And I had a hell of a time learning from the master. Years later, when I actually got to meet Ed McBain/Evan Hunter, I told him this story, and he said, &#x201c;I would have liked it better if my books inspired you to become a detective instead of becoming my competition.&#x201d; Evan and I became friends, and I was privileged to know him and honored to be in his company. I remain indebted to him for his good advice over the years. But most of all, I thank him for hundreds of hours of great reading. --<em>Nelson DeMille</em> <p>To read about how Ed McBain influenced other mystery and thriller writers, visit our Perspectives on McBain page.</p> <p>For a complete selection of 87th Precinct novels available from Thomas &amp; Mercer, visit our Ed McBain's 87th Precinct Booklist.</p>Ed McBain has been the recipient of the Grand Master Award of the Mystery Writers of America.

Easily. Maybe ten years.&#39; Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club Following a near fatal overdose of painkillers, Daniel Fletcher is resuscitated in a Los Angeles emergency room and detained for psychiatric evaluation. Through a series of questions and tests, the psychiatrist must ascertain whether the patient intended to kill himself, or whether he can walk free. What the psychiatrist doesn&#39;t know is that &#39;Daniel Fletcher&#39; is actually John - Johnny - Dolan Vincent, a brilliant young forger who continually changes his identity to save himself from a lifetime of incarceration. Johnny has done such assessments before - many, many times. As he creates an elaborate bluff for the evaluator, Johnny reveals the true story of his traumatic past - a broken family, descent into the sinister world of forgers and criminals, and his one chance of salvation in the beautiful and elusive Molly. But time is running out; as his underworld clients lose patience and the psychiatrist&#39;s net closes around him, Johnny has to negotiate the escape act of his life. Evoking the boulevards and strip bars of 1980s LA with cinematic intensity, The Contortionist&#39;s Handbook is a darkly hypnotic and stunningly original debut.</p><p>Craig Clevenger was born in Dallas, Texas and raised in Southern California, where he studied English at California State University, Long Beach. He has travelled extensively and lived in Dublin and London, but currently resides in California where he is at work on his second novel, Dermaphoria.Clevenger's debut novel is a well-crafted but underplotted character study of a brilliant, damaged man who struggles with mental illness and substance abuse as he bounces in and out of prison and a series of hospitals around Los Angeles. Most of the novel takes place in the latter setting; some tense early scenes pit protagonist John Dolan Vincent against a psychiatrist known as "The Evaluator," who probes Vincent's psyche to see if his recent overdose of muscle relaxants was really a botched attempt to cure his migraine, as Vincent claims, or a suicide attempt. The twist is that Vincent has checked into the hospital under an assumed name; after each of his previous overdoses he has changed his identity to avoid being placed in a mental hospital. The psychiatric interview provides a decent vehicle for telling the story of Vincent's difficult family life and his decision to use his mathematical talent to assist a murky criminal network. The trouble is that Clevenger has little to offer to push his story forward besides Vincent's efforts to protect Keadra, the woman he falls in love with during a hospital stint, from the thugs who are trying to track him down. Clevenger is a solid writer who does some good work when it comes to creating a noirish atmosphere and smart, compelling characters, but the pace is uneven at best. The quality of the writing warrants a follow-up effort; hopefully, Clevenger will know what to do with his characters the next time around.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Daniel Defoe: The Life and Strange Adventures</h2><p>The colorful life of a literary phenomenon and masterfully crafted biography that&#39;s won applause from readers and critics alike. Intimate with monarchs, pilloried at Newgate Prison, hounded by his creditors to the day he died, the maverick newsman, satirist, soldier, and spy Daniel Defoe did not so much defy contradiction as epitomize it. So Richard West continually demonstrates in this spirited biography of the indefatigable Puritan pamphleteer who earned himself literary immortality with such novels as the scandalous Moll Flanders and the all-time bestselling Robinson Crusoe. &#34;Richard West has provided what must now be counted as the standard popular life of Defoe, chronicling the irresistible story of this writer with an appropriate passion.&#34; - Wall Street Journal &#34;This lively book rambles across [Defoe&#39;s] England . . . that realm of fops, rogues, merchants, sailors, unctuous divines, and fugitive pamphleteers&#34; - New York Times Book Review &#34;Vivid and comprehensive&#34; - San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle &#34;A full account of Defoe&#39;s tempestuous life and times in a biography that doubles as a one-volume history of 17th- and early 18th-century England&#34; - Washington Post Book World &#34;Readable, entertaining, colorful, and hugely informative blend&#34; - Christian Science Monitor &#34;Delightful&#34; - Atlantic Monthly</p><p>It's not surprising that West, an Englishman and the veteran author of numerous books on history and travel, is an admirer of "the fertility of Defoe's brain as well as the physical strength of his writing hand." West's life of the prolific if unconventional journalist who invented so much of his nonfiction that he moved easily into the novel, begins rather stiffly but becomes livelier as Defoe (1660-1731) grows up, writes more and gets into more trouble. West concedes at the start that he has not written "a definitive, academic, or even scholarly analysis of Defoe's writing." Nor has he produced a biography, he confesses, to replace Paula Backschneider's far more substantial Daniel Defoe (1989). Rather, inspired by Defoe's semifictional three-volume A Tour of the Whole Island of Great Britain (to West the writer's masterpiece), he turns to Defoe's neglected, often imaginative travel books and the author's equally slighted run of lively and pioneering news-and-gossip papers of 1704-13. West's life, then, is for readers who want to know more about the compulsive writer, royal secret agent and bankrupt London merchant than the author of Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders and his pseudo-histories and pseudo-memoirs. Defoe's method, West contends, was "the exercise of imagination?quite a different thing from invention or lying." Much more than a political pamphleteer and political spy, or the tireless hack penning bogus autobiographies, Defoe emerges in West's colorful (if sourceless) biography as an adventurer whose authentic life might have made his best book. 16 pages of b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Few biographical subjects have led more intriguing lives than Defoe (1660^-1731). He is most famous as the author of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, but that ur-novel was a product of the penultimate of several careers. Defoe had been a rebel soldier, a feckless entrepreneur, a fearless pamphleteer, a confidant to King William III, a Tory government spy, and a pioneering political journalist before becoming a book writer who mixed fiction and fact so smoothly that literary detectives are still sifting the realities out of his so-called novels and the fancies out of his classic <i>Tour of the Whole Island of Great Britain</i>. Bankrupted young, he later sat in the pillory for the sake of a free press and proved so politically independent that he was finally attacked by Tories and Whigs alike. Meanwhile, he sired seven children in his marriage to the long-suffering Mary Tuffley. During his last years, though a semi-invalid after a horrible operation for bladder stones, he ventured into business again, with similar sad results. He died fleeing his creditors and, as always, writing and publishing. Although West devotes most of this big book's latter half to synopses--with more extrapolation than exegesis in them--of the novels and the <i>Tour</i> and seems not to have done any original research, he writes splendidly, reanimating Defoe and his genuinely turbulent era (seventeenth-century England, in particular, was as brutal and dangerous as contemporary Bosnia) in a smart and engrossing popular biography. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>A Poetics of Women&#39;s Autobiography: Marginality and the Fictions of Self-Representation</h2><p>ix 211p paperback, old price mark to title page, a firm copy, all other pages clean, in very good condition</p><p></p><h2>Beaded Jewelry The Complete Guide</h2><p><p><b>Your One-Stop Source for Beading Know-How</b></p><p>Jewelry and beading expert <b>Susan Ray</b>, along with dozens of expert jewelry artists, bring you this complete tutorial for making your own jewelry to fit your personal style.

I had done volunteer campaign work there during the summer after the Republican Convention, and on weekends. Having obtained permission to be absent from high school on Election Day to hand out Goldwater leaflets at a nearby precinct, I was in Catonsville when Maryland's polls closed to await the national returns. Although Lyndon Johnson seemed to have a large lead going into the election, I remained optimistic that Barry Goldwater would run well, and might even pull off an upset.</p><p>So much for the early signs of a promising political career. Goldwater was crushed, in what was then the worst presidential election defeat in American history. At the Catonsville office, which had become quite crowded, many of the adult volunteers (I was just about the only teenager there) were weeping, something I had never seen before in public. I was somewhat puzzled by this display of emotion, but I was more puzzled by the election results, which were going from bad to worse. Dean Burch, Goldwater's chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, "As the sun sets in the West, the Republican star will rise." I believed that for a while, until it became ever more obvious that "down" was the only direction in which Goldwater was headed.</p><p>It took weeks for the extent of the defeat to penetrate fully into my befuddled brain. When a few brave souls, just weeks afterward, printed bumper stickers that read "AuH2O '68," I was ready to sign up again. After all, the American people could not really vote in overwhelming numbers for a candidate who said things like, "I want y'all to know that the Democratic Party is in favor of a mighty lot of things, and against mighty few." I had read Goldwater's <i>Why Not Victory?</i> and <i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i>, and fiercely admired the Arizonan's philosophy and candor. He was an individualist, not a collectivist, who said without reservation, "My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them."1 He was against "the Eastern Establishment," which conservatives saw as a major source of our misguided statist policies at home, and what Barry called "drift, deception, and defeat" in the international struggle against Communism. I cheered when Barry said we should cut off the eastern seaboard and let it drift out to sea, even though my own state of Maryland would have been drifting out there as well. Later, after he returned to the Senate, Goldwater began a letter to the CIA director, "Dear Bill: I am pissed off." (How many times in my own government career did I long to write a letter like that, although I never did.) In my heart, I knew Barry was right.</p><p>While I thought the 1964 presidential election was a no-brainer, I was obviously part of a distinct minority, even though others would bravely say of Goldwater's popular vote total that "twenty-six million Americans can't be wrong." It would have been entirely logical after 1964 to give up politics as completely hopeless, and go on to a career, say, in the Foreign Service, as I seriously contemplated. Or I might have drifted off to the left in college, as so many of my contemporaries did. But like many others whose first taste of electoral politics came in the Goldwater campaign, I had exactly the opposite reaction. If the sustained and systematic distortion of a fine man's philosophy could succeed, abetted by every major media outlet in the country, overwhelmingly supported by the elite academic institutions, to the tune of negative advertising like Johnson's famous "daisy commercial," which accused Goldwater of being too casual about nuclear war, and slogans like "Goldwater for Halloween," it was time to fight back. If the United States was in such parlous condition that people who showed off their appendectomy scars in public and held up beagles by their ears could get elected president, something had to be done. Surrender was not an option.</p><p>Thirty-six years later, election night 2000 was a very different affair. Beginning in 1968, Republicans had dominated American presidential politics. Only the unfortunate elections of two failed southern governors had intervened, and the objective in 2000 was to prevent the second Democratic interruption from being extended. Unlike 1964, however, the 2000 election was excruciatingly close, and I didn't stay around to await the outcome. I left for Seoul the morning after the election to participate in a conference on Korea-related policy issues at Yonsei University, which was cohosted by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where I was senior vice president. When I checked into my hotel in Seoul late on Thursday, Korea time, the Florida outcome remained up in the air. After a long day on Friday, I turned on the television in my hotel room and found that chaos still reigned in Florida, with no final result.</p><p>Most significantly for me, Governor George W. Bush had named Jim Baker, my former boss at the State Department during the previous Bush administration, to lead his effort to salvage Florida's electoral vote. No one at that point had the slightest idea of what might be involved, or how long it would take to decide the evolving contest. Before I collapsed into bed early that Friday evening in Seoul, I left a voice message for Baker at his Houston law firm. I explained that I was in South Korea, but offered to fly to Florida to help. At about 2:00 a.m. Seoul time, the phone rang, and I picked it up to hear Baker's unmistakable Texas twang saying, "Get your ass on a plane and get back here."</p><p>Just a few days later, I was in West Palm Beach, part of the great "chad" exercise. I stopped first in Tallahassee, but Baker immediately dispatched me to Palm Beach where he thought a "heavyweight lawyer" should be added to the team already diligently at work. Ken Mehlman, later Republican Party chairman, called me "the Atticus Finch of Palm Beach County," but there were many, many people volunteering. Hour after hour we sat, psychoanalyzing ballot cards. This was the process Democrats hoped would produce a change in Florida's popular vote totals and award them the state's electoral vote, and therefore the national election. One of my AEI colleagues, Michael Novak, a former Democrat, feared the worst, as he watched on television a battle between "the street fighters and the preppies." It turned out we won despite our rosy cheeks. I tried to go home for Thanksgiving, but I was called back to Palm Beach just as I arrived in Washington. My family couldn't face weeks of eating turkey without me, so I returned ours to the local grocery store on Thanksgiving morning, which was certainly a first for me, and flew back to Palm Beach. On the evening of December 12, the Supreme Court ended the struggle in Bush's favor, and quite correctly, as a matter of law, I might add. I was in Baker's office when he called Texas to tell the candidate the good news, saying to Bush, for the first time legitimately, "Congratulations, Mr. President."</p><p>After more than a month in Florida, one of the great emotional roller-coaster rides of my professional life, I flew back to Washington on a private plane with Margaret Tutwiler, a long-time Baker aide.We agreed it had been a completely different experience from our time in the State Department during the first Bush administration. It was only a matter of time, however, before both of us found ourselves back at the State Department, where Chad was a country in Africa, not a tiny bit of meaningful paper.</p><p>Between the 1964 and 2000 elections, a lot had happened to me, demonstrating in my own experience the definition of "history" as "one damned thing after another," with a few preliminary events before 1964 to get me to that unhappy Goldwater election headquarters in Catonsville.</p><p>I started out in Baltimore on November 20, 1948, a baby boomer by any definition of the term, the son of a Baltimore firefighter, Edward Jackson Bolton ("Jack" to everyone) and his "housewife," as we used to say, from Wilmington, Delaware, Virginia Clara Godfrey, or "Ginny." Neither had graduated from high school, but I have no doubt that my own academic record was based on the genes I inherited from them, since it certainly did not come from our social contacts or standing in society. All four of my grandparents, who were mostly Scotch-Irish or Irish, emigrated to the United States in the early 1900s, so my parents were first-generation Americans who had grown up during the Depression and been steeled by World War II. They didn't need anyone to tell them that they had been through tough times, and they were determined, like most in their generation, that their children were not going to repeat their experiences.</p><p>Jack lied about his age to join the Coast Guard once World War II started, eager to go to sea, not a surprising aspiration for a Baltimore boy, living in the East Coast's second-largest port after New York. Unfortunately, first assigned to land duty, he made it to sea by dropping a pan of fried eggs on the shoes of an officer who had pushed him a little further than he wanted to go.The ships on which he'd served looked like big hunks of ice, escorting cargoes across the North Atlantic, or so I thought years later when my father showed me the tiny photographs he'd kept. Wounded on D-Day off the coast of France, Jack spent the rest of the war recuperating in Florida, tending to the morale of the stateside female population, or at least that's how he described it. Back in Baltimore, after 1945, he knocked around for a while, and then got married, starting out as a plumber. The union rules, which resulted in what seemed to him to be endless hours of sitting around, finally prompted him to seek something more exciting, perhaps never having shaken the peculiar hold of wartime experience. He became a firefighter for the city of Baltimore, a d...</p></p><h2>Mrs. Armitage and the Big Wave</h2><p>Surf&#x2019;s up! Mrs. Armitage and her dog, Breakspear, paddle out to surf the Big Wave. Soon the kindly Mrs. Armitage notices that Breakspear&#x2019;s little legs are getting tired--so she swims off and returns with an inflatable desert island for him to rest on. Then she notices that Breakspear looks a little hot--so she swims off again and brings back an umbrella. Soon this silly pair is loaded down with flags, a horn, megaphones, and lots of other gear. What will they do when the Big Wave finally arrives?<br></p><p>No BioAges 4^-7. After arriving at the beach with a surfboard, Mrs. Armitage and her dog, Breakspear, swim out and wait for the Big Wave. But Breakspear's legs get tired paddling, so Mrs. Armitage swims back to shore to buy him an inflatable island. After more waiting, she decides that they need a hat and an umbrella for protection against the sun, so she swims back to get them. More trips are needed to procure a good stock of provisions, a wind sock, a string of flags, a horn, and a megaphone. When the Big Wave finally comes, they ride it in style and rescue a little girl named Miranda on their way to shore. The sunlit colors of Blake's palette, the carefree informality of his ink drawings, and the mannered formality of Mrs. Armitage's speech make this a treat to read aloud. Children will want to stop and savor the double-page spread showing the wonderful, impossible, inevitable triumph of Mrs. Armitage, Breakspear, and Miranda as they do the Waikiki flip under the curl of the Big Wave.

Simon&#x2019;s portraits are accompanied by a commentary by Neufeld and Scheck.</p></p><p><i>The Innocents</i> is a book of portraits of former inmates accompanying a traveling exhibit by the same name mounted by the Innocence Project, a 10-year-old civil rights program founded by rock-star attorneys Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck to free the wrongly convicted via DNA testing. Neufeld and Scheck provide the book's foreward and brief commentary on each case. The subjects are all ex-cons who were exonerated through DNA testing and then released after serving time. Some had been sentenced to life, some to death. Taryn Simon's photographs put prisoners in the spotlight--only this time they regain their dignity and become art in the process. Of the 80-plus portraits in the book, most were taken at the scenes of the crimes. Some pose with the victims. Ronald Cotton, for example, served more than 10 years of a life sentence for rape. He is photographed with a victim, both of them staring at the camera with fortitude and bitterness. Nearly every picture is similar, the subject staring directly into the lens, always surrounded by the same eerie, diffused light like the kind when tornadoes loom. The subjects are interviewed by Simon as well; their commentary is also distressing and poignant. Neil Miller says he had a better life in prison. Richard Danziger was freed but rendered brain damaged by a jailhouse attacker. Walter Snyder went to prison instead of the Olympics. Most of these subjects were convicted on the basis of witness misidentification. Simon's photos are also like mug shots, depicting their subjects with emotionless expressions and using lighting that flattens out the surroundings. But here they set the record straight as Simon&#x2019;s art helps re-humanize them. <i>--Eric Reyes</i>Taryn Simon was born in 1975 in New York. In 1997, she graduated from Brown University.

This is the Britain of mist-drenched forests and unpredictable sea-frets: of wraith-like fog banks, druidic mistletoe and peculiar creatures that lurk, half-unseen, in the undergrowth, tantalising and teasing just at the periphery of human vision. How have the remarkably persistent folkloric traditions of the British Isles formed and been formed by the identities and psyches of those who inhabit them? In her sparkling new history, Carolyne Larrington explores the diverse ways in which a myriad of imaginary and fantastical beings has moulded the cultural history of the nation. Fairies, elves and goblins here tread purposefully, sometimes malignly, over an eerie, preternatural landscape that also conceals brownies, selkies, trows, knockers, boggarts, land-wights, Jack o'Lanterns, Barguests, the sinister Nuckleavee, or water-horse, and even Black Shuck: terrifying hell-hound of the Norfolk coast with eyes of burning coal. Focusing on liminal points where the boundaries between this world and that of the supernatural grow thin &#x2013; those marginal tide-banks, saltmarshes, floodplains, moors and rock-pools wherein mystery lies &#x2013; the author shows how mythologies of Mermen, Green men and Wild-men have helped and continue to help human beings deal with such ubiquitous concerns as love and lust, loss and death and continuity and change. Evoking the Wild Hunt, the ghostly bells of Lyonesse and the dread fenlands haunted by Grendel, and ranging the while from Shetland to Jersey and from Ireland to East Anglia, this is a book that will captivate all those who long for the wild places: the mountains and chasms where Gog, Magog and their fellow giants lie in wait.</p><p>Carolyne Larrington is Fellow and Tutor in Medieval English Literature at St John&#x2019;s College, Oxford.

But is the book really about "animal camouflage," as the title suggests? Not quite. Students are tasked with finding the selected creatures using the negative white space, rather than spotting actual camouflage. (If the paper, for example, is green, then the animals are also green; what makes them visible is that the cut-away pieces are white, which provides a contrast that makes the animals and plants recognizable.) While the artwork is impressive, the text is quite brief. Seven regions are introduced, animals are presented, and readers are asked to spot them. There are no maps and very little information is provided overall.

At the other are the novellas, several of which, including The Soldier's Legacy (published separately in 1985), have the weight and density of novels. The total range is widefrom droll and facetious, mordant and caustic, as Boll could be when observing the grubby lives of his compatriots, to the brooding intensity of the pieces haunted by the Hitler era, telling of his own experiences as a draftee in the Wehrmacht (thought he was a Catholic pacifist) and as a prisoner of war. Better, a character says in a kind of summing-up, to be "a dead Jew than a live German." If the lesser pieces are forgettably slight, overall the writer's distinctive virtues prevail: his wide culture and cultivated intelligence; his gift for parable and fable; his humane sensibility and eye for the mindless cruelties and desolations of war. And, perhaps above all, his talentas a character remarks, "for turning everything into a symbolic event."

I&#x2019;m a city kid by birth and upbringing, and though I like living in the country--a good place to raise kids, a good place to work--my inspiration has always come from the mix of faces, voices, and characters of urban life. <p></p> I never plan what I&#x2019;m going to write, and never outline. I just sit down with a pad of yellow paper and a favorite fountain pen, or with my laptop, start putting words on the page or screen and see where it leads. This time it led me into the world of Marjorie Richards, a remarkable seventeen-year-old young woman whose life is about as different from my own as two lives can be. It wasn&#x2019;t until I was hundreds of pages into the book that I remembered something I&#x2019;d seen in a convenience store in Pownal, Vermont, in the early 1980&#x2019;s, and realized the story had its origins there. <p></p> What I saw and heard in that store, on the way home from a day of carpentry, was a dirty, poorly-dressed young mother chastising her dirty, poorly-dressed two-year-old with a bizarre, illogical, racist taunt. Just a couple of sentences, just an over-wrought mother losing it with her child, but it was a glimpse into the hidden world of rural poverty. There we were, five miles north of Williams College and five miles south of Bennington College, and a sad, hidden American underbelly was showing its face to me. <p></p> I won&#x2019;t repeat what the mother said here--her remark can be found about three-quarters of the way through the novel. At the time, unforgettable as the moment was, I certainly never imagined writing about it. But so many years later I found myself wondering what that little child&#x2019;s life was like then, and what kind of adulthood it turned into. If his mother would say such things in public, what went on in the privacy of their home? I have always been interested in the workings of the family, and in the inner lives of children (and adults), and it&#x2019;s clear to me now that <i>The Talk-Funny Girl</i> grew out of that interest, sparked by the moment in Pownal. <p></p> Another persistent fascination--from my first novel, <i>Leaving Losapas</i>, until this day--is the way people manage to put themselves back together after a difficult or traumatic experience. War, divorce, addiction, illness, the loss of a loved one--these are subjects that have found their way into all my stories over the past couple of decades. The fascination with people who overcome such things led me to Marjorie Richards, raised by crazy parents, in poverty, in west-central New Hampshire, so this is really the story of her bravery, her refusal to surrender to the forces that beset her. She personifies that mysterious stubbornness you see in good people who&#x2019;ve been through bad times, and I mean the novel as a gesture of compassion for mistreated kids, and a tribute to the ones, like her, who overcome mistreatment and do everything they can not to pass it on. <p></p>ROLAND MERULLO is the acclaimed author of twelve previous books, including <i>Revere Beach Boulevard, In Revere in Those Days, A Little Love Story, Golfing with God, Breakfast with Buddha,</i> and <i>American Savior</i>.

Under the aegis of security and convenience, Parenti argues, corporations and the U.S. government, often working together, have, without any oversight, substantially eroded civil liberties-including the right to privacy -that Americans have long taken for granted.</p><p><b>Christian Parenti</b> is the author of <i>Lockdown America</i> . His writing appears regularly in <i>The Nation</i> , the <i>San Diego Union Tribune</i> , and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> . He has a Ph.D. in sociology from the London School of Economics and is currently a Soros Senior Justice Fellow at the Open Society Institute and a fellow at the Center for the Study of Place, Culture and Politics, CUNY Graduate Center. He lives in Brooklyn.Attempts to keep an eye on Americans are nothing new, Parenti argues in this well-researched albeit pedantic history of ways people have been controlled in the U.S. Relying on the theories of scholar Michel Foucault-who used surveillance and control as two of his central themes-Parenti begins with slavery, focusing on the slave passes that slaveowners used to keep their human property in place. He then moves on to new crime controls, like fingerprinting, that accompanied increased urbanization. Throughout, he emphasizes how new technology has always increased the government's ability to spy on its citizens. So it's no surprise that the current rise in technology comes in for special criticism. Credit cards, ATMs, highway toll passes such as E-ZPass are all tools that the government can employ to curtail freedom. There's a lot of food for thought here (and some troubling aspects of American history brought to light). But Parenti's lens is too sharp and his antigovernment animus too apparent. As he himself admits, most Americans seem to think that some liberties are worth trading in if they bring more security. There's no doubt that books focusing on this topic can be helpful contributions to the national discourse, but when Parenti sees post-September 11 not as a shift toward cracking down on civil liberties but as more of the same, many readers will likely feel he is a bit off base. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Natchez Flame (Southern)</h2><p>A woman of courage and honor.

Priscilla Mae Wills stood at the rail of the steamship Orleans surveying the scattered wooden buildings, weathered and unpainted, and the unkempt, seedy-looking men who lined the dock of the strand.<br><br>In the distance, the dirt streets of Galveston bustled with activity, wagons heavy with bales of cotton rumbling toward the wharf, men and animals clattering along in confusion. Puddles of mud still dotted the road from a recent summer rain.<br><br>Though the rest of the passengers had already departed, Priscilla searched the long wooden dock for the hundredth time, hoping against hope that Barker Hennessey, the man sent to meet her, had discovered the Orlean's early arrival and might yet appear.<br><br>You're a grown woman, Priscilla. You can do this on your own. But in all her twenty-four years she'd never traveled by herself, and even with her Aunt Madeline had never gone far from home. And she'd certainly never expected the newly formed state of Texas to be this untamed.<br><br>Bedraggled and wind-chafed and tired clear to her bones, Priscilla scanned the dock in search of anyone who might be Barker Hennessey. Several brown-skinned Mexican men singing in Spanish strolled past, but no one that her fianc&#x17d; could possibly have sent to meet her.<br><br>Forcing a stiffness into her spine, she stepped off the wharf onto the wide dirt streets. A hot, muggy breeze whipped the dark brown skirts of her serviceable cotton day dress, and with every weary step the stiff white ruffle around the neck scratched the soft white skin beneath her chin. Strands of dark brown hair had come loose from the tight chignon hidden at the back of her bonnet and whipped tauntingly in the wind.<br><br>Priscilla glanced up the street. The sign for the Galveston Hotel and Saloon gleamed red and white in the hot July sunshine beside another large painted sign advertising Samuel Levinson's Bath House. Barker Hennessey, the man her fianc&#x17d;, Stuart Egan, had sent to escort her on the final leg of her journey, would look for her at the hotel once he discovered her ship had come in.<br><br>And someone from the hotel could fetch the heavy steamer trunks that contained her trousseau: the finely crafted dresses she had carefully sewn over the past few weeks, as well as the doilies and linens and dainty embroidered tablecloths she had stitched and laid in her hope chest throughout the years.<br><br>Determined to ignore the heat and the tightly laced stays of her steel-ribbed corset, Priscilla walked the bustling dirt streets. Weathered batten-board structures crouched beside a few sturdy establishments built of pinkish-white stone.<br><br>The hotel was by far the best-looking building in town, she thought as she drew near. At least the paint wasn't peeling and the walk in front had been swept clean. It was a far cry from Cincinnati, with its sophisticated brownstones, elegant restaurants, and lavish opera houses. Still the thought of being inside, out of the blistering sunshine, made her quicken her pace.<br><br>That's when she noticed the commotion out front. A crowd had gathered, grumbling among itself, then seemed to be backing away.<br><br>"Look, Jacob--ain't that Barker Hennessey?" a slender man in a red-checkered shirt asked the small man beside him. The name registered immediately, and Priscilla glanced toward the big-boned man at the opposite end of the porch.<br><br>"That's him, all right," Jacob said. "Barker's madder'n a wet hen 'cause he lost his poke to some gambler."<br><br>Gambling, Priscilla thought, feeling sorry for the big strapping man in the black felt hat who stood in front of the swinging double doors to the saloon, the devil's own sport. But hearing his name, she also felt a wave of relief that she had found him so easily.<br><br>"Excuse me, please." Nudging her way through the crowd, she headed for the porch, intent on catching Mr. Hennessey before he got away. With her mind on the coming introduction, it took a moment for her to realize he was speaking.<br><br>"You're a cheat and a liar!" Hennessey called out just as she stepped on the boardwalk. "I want my money back, Trask, and I aim to get it!"<br><br>At the angry tone of his words, Priscilla swung her gaze toward the object of his wrath, the tall, broad-shouldered man standing right beside her.<br><br>"I won that money fair, and you know it," Trask said.<br><br>"Mr. Hennessey!" Priscilla called out, waving a white-gloved hand and starting in his direction.<br><br>"Goddamn it!"<br><br>Priscilla felt the tall man's hand on her arm, his grip so hard it made her flinch. His free hand slapped against the leather holster tied to one long leg. She saw the bluish flash of metal, heard the deafening roar of gunfire. Whipping her head toward Barker, Priscilla breathed the acrid smell of burnt powder and stared in horror at the opposite end of the porch.<br><br>Barker Hennessey's eyes remained open, his mouth gaping wide in an expression of astonishment. He swayed on his feet while his sausage-sized fingers clutched the still-smoking pistol in his hand. Only a trickle of blood ran from the small round circle that marked the entrance of the tall man's bullet--centered squarely between his eyes.<br><br>Watching Hennessey crumple to the porch, Priscilla wet her suddenly dry lips. Her mouth moved as she tried to say the words that hovered at the corners of her mind, but no sound would come. Her ears buzzed and her knees felt weak. The images on the porch suddenly blurred and jumbled.<br><br>Heart hammering, she swayed toward the man named Trask whose painful grip seemed the only thing holding her up. His angry blue eyes fastened on her face just seconds before her lids flickered closed, the world tumbled sideways, and Priscilla sank into darkness.<br><br>"Jesus Christ, what next?" Brendan Trask swung the slender young woman up into his arms and stepped off the boardwalk onto the street.<br><br>"Nice shootin'!" Jacob Barnes called out to him as he strode toward the shade of an oak tree that grew beside the watering trough just half a block away.<br><br>"You'd better get the sheriff," Brendan called back without breaking his long-legged stride.<br><br>She all right?" the little man asked, catching up and trying to keep pace without running.<br><br>"Just fainted. She's lucky she didn't stop a bullet." Brendan recalled all too clearly the moment she'd started to step in front of him. He glanced down at the small round hole in the full white sleeve of his shirt.<br><br>The man followed his gaze. "Lucky ain't the half of it."<br><br>"Get the sheriff," Trask reminded him.<br><br>"Sheriff got hisse'f kilt last week. I'll see if'n his deputy's down at Gilroy's Saloon." The man scurried off to find the law, though Brendan figured what little there was had probably already been summoned. Galveston might be the wildest port on the Gulf, but a shooting was a shooting, and Barker Hennessey worked for one of the most powerful men in the country.<br><br>"Damn." Brendan said the word beneath his breath, wishing he could have avoided the killing, but Hennessey had left him no choice. He just hoped to hell there wouldn't be trouble.<br><br>He'd had enough of that already.<br><br>Brendan propped the lady against the trunk of the oak tree, noting her somber brown dress, high-necked and long-sleeved, and the tiny waist pulled tight by her corset. Clothes like that in this heat--no wonder she'd fainted. Sometimes women didn't have the sense God gave a mule.<br><br>Shaking his head at life's little absurdities, Brendan walked to the old stone trough where a young boy watered several horses. The animals nickered and blew, sucking in great gulps of the cool reviving liquid.<br><br>"Guess I missed all the fun," the youth said, a boy of about fourteen. He looked down at the gun riding low on Trask's hip, unlike the pistols of most men, who wore theirs at the waist, and noted the flap that had been cut away from the heavy leather holster for easier access.<br><br>He puffed out his chest. "Been savin' my money for a gun of my own. Someday I'll be able to shoot like that. Man don't have to clean stalls and tend horses, he kin shoot like that."<br><br>rendan flashed him a look that made him take a step backwards and melted his cocky half-smile. "Better to be cleaning stalls than lying out there in the street. That dead man could just as well have been me--someday it probably will be. You'd best think on that, son.<br><br>"Turning away from the boy, Brendan dipped his handkerchief into the water, wrung out the excess, and returned to the base of the oak tree. He untied the woman's bonnet strings and pressed the wet cloth against her forehead.<br><br>At the sound of a soft moan, he wet her dry lips. They were full, he noticed and a delicate shade of pink. Her features held a trace of that same fragility: slim, straight nose, fine chestnut eyebrows, thick dark lashes. She wasn't really a beauty, but she was definitely attractive.He thought of Patsy Jackson, the woman he'd spent the night with. He remembered her full ripe curves, red-painted mouth, and fun-loving warmth in bed. There was nothing frail about Patsy, nothing prim or proper. She was the kind of woman who could pleasure a man, have a rollicking good time in bed, but didn't give you trouble in the morning.<br><br>Not like this one. This little miss would probably pass out again just thinking about what he had done to Patsy last night. Pretty as she was, she held little appeal for him. Brendan liked his women lusty.<br><br>Still, in a town where men outnumbered women a dozen to one, she'd undoubtedly be considered quite a catch. He wondered which man she belonged to--and why that man hadn't the good sense to keep her out of trouble.<br><br>She moaned a second time, and her lids fluttered open. Warm-brown, gold-flecked eyes looked up at him in confusion. Brendan shoved his broad-brimmed hat back on his head and assessed her pale oval face. If he hadn't spotted her from the corner of his eye, she'd probably be dead right now. The thought sent a shudder down his spine, and a bit of his anger returned.<br><br>"Lady, you are some piece of goods." The words came out a little harsher than he had intended. "What the hell did you think you were doing? Don't you know any better than to stroll into the middle of a gunfight?"<br><br>"Gunfight?" she repeated, looking more confused than ever. Her pretty face paled even more. <br><br>"Mr. Hennessey," she said, sitting up straighter, "is he . . . is he . . .?"<br><br>"Barker picked that fight, not me. I won his money fair and square, and I shot him in self-defense."<br><br>"Oh, dear," she said, looking ready to faint again. Her dainty pink tongue wet her lips. "I don't feel very good. I think I'm going to be sick."<br><br>"Oh, no, you don't--" Brendan pressed the cool wet cloth against her brow. "Just lean your head back and try not to think about it."<br><br>The woman swallowed hard and closed her eyes. Eventually the color returned to her cheeks, and he noticed again how pretty she was. Catching the glitter of the sun on wisps of shiny dark hair beside her cheeks, he wondered what the heavy mass would look like freed from her wide-brimmed, coal-scuttle bonnet.<br><br>"Thank you," she said softly, taking the cloth from his hand. "I'm feeling a little better now."<br><br>Brendan felt a wave of relief, until an unpleasant thought occurred. "Barker wasn't your husband, was he?" Until that moment it hadn't crossed his mind that a man like Hennessey could have a wife. Especially such a young and tender one.<br><br>She shook her head. "No. He's the man my fianc&#x17d; sent to escort me on to his ranch." Her bottom lip trembled. "I never met him before, but he looked like a nice enough man."<br><br>Brendan's face went taut. "There wasn't a nice bone in Barker Hennessey's body. He'd have killed me without a second thought if I hadn't shot him first."<br><br>Priscilla chewed on that for a while and took a long assessing look at the man who squatted with easy grace on the stiff salt grass beside her. His hair was as dark as hers, but a richer, warmer shade of brown, and he wore it longer than he should have. Several days' growth of beard roughened a rugged jawline, but his mouth curved nicely and his eyes, a light shade of blue, watched her with a look of concern that melted away at the fear she should have felt.<br><br>How could that be? she wondered. He'd just killed a man--a man whose help she desperately needed. He was a gambler and a gunman, yet there was an honesty about him, a sense of compassion--and something else she couldn't quite name. Something that told her the words he spoke were true.<br><br>"Does that mean the sheriff won't arrest you?"<br><br>"Not as long as he learns the truth," he said with sincerity.<br><br>Priscilla had always had a knack for judging people. Since she was a girl, she could size a person up in only a meeting or two. On making a new acquaintance, Aunt Maddie often asked her opinion, though she never admitted Priscilla's assessment actually mattered.<br><br>And this man had saved her life--probably at considerable risk to his own.He took her hand and helped her climb shakily to her feet. Priscilla clutched his arm to steady herself and felt the flex of muscle beneath his shirt. Though she stood taller than the average woman, Trask towered above her, his wide shoulders blocking the hot yellow rays of the sun. Hard-edged, unkempt, and rugged though he appeared, even in his worn homespun shirt and frayed blue twill breeches he was handsome.<br><br>When he discovered her watching him, Priscilla flushed and glanced away. "I . . . I can't believe Stuart would have sent the kind of man you describe here to meet me. We would be traveling together and I don't think--"<br><br>"This is rough country, Miss . . . ?"<br><br>She swung her gaze to his. "Wills. Priscilla Mae Wills, and I believe your name is Trask."<br><br>He nodded. "Where did you say you were headed?"<br><br>"Rancho Reina del Robles--the Triple R. Stuart Egan is my fianc&#x17d;."<br><br>Trask's hard features closed up. There was an edge to his voice that hadn't been there before. "That explains Hennessey--he's Egan's right-hand man."<br><br>"Then you know Stuart?"<br><br>He shook his head. "No, but I've heard of him. Most folks 'round these parts know who he is. Why didn't Egan come for you himself?"<br><br>"Apparently he was short-handed. The ranch is quite large, you know."<br><br>"So I've heard." Something flickered in his light blue eyes. "I'll have someone get word to him and he can fetch you home."<br><br>Priscilla's dark brows shot up. "But that would take weeks! I can't stay here--"<br><br>She felt his hand on her arm, halting her protest and urging her back toward the hotel.<br><br>Priscilla let him lead her, trying to gather her thoughts. From what Stuart had written, the ranch was still quite some distance away. It would take weeks for a letter to reach it and just as much time for Stuart to come, or send someone to get her. In the meantime she'd be alone in this wild Texas town. A place where people got shot in the streets! She had only enough money for a few days lodging and food--what would she do after that?<br><br>As they approached the hotel, Priscilla surveyed the porch in dread, expecting to see Barker Hennessey's lifeless body sprawled on the boardwalk among a crowd of onlookers. Instead only a handful of men lounged beside the door of the saloon. The plinkity plink of a cheap piano and the high-pitched sound of women's laughter seemed almost sacrilegious in light of what had just happened.The scraping of a chair drew her attention.<br><br>"Where'd you get the new gal, Trask?" one of the rough-looking men called out. <br><br>"Looks like a real little lady--you always did have a way with the women."

Perhaps you have had the funny feeling that God wants to get your attention. Or maybe you're intrigued with what you've heard about Jesus. Or maybe you're simply looking for meaning and direction in your life. John Stott has spent a lifetime wrestling with questions about Jesus both personally and in dialogue with skeptics and seekers around the globe. Now in <em>Why I Am a Christian</em> he provides a compelling, persuasive case for considering the Christian faith. If you take an honest look at Jesus, you will discover that following him gives you the purpose, identity and freedom you've been searching for--and far more than you have ever imagined.</p><p>John R. W. Stott (1921-2011) has been known worldwide as a preacher, evangelist and communicator of Scripture. For many years he served as rector of All Souls Church in London, where he carried out an effective urban pastoral ministry. A leader among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and around the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark Lausanne Covenant (1974). His many books have sold millions of copies around the world and in dozens of languages. Stott&#x2019;s best-known work, <em>Basic Christianity,</em> has sold two million copies and has been translated into more than 60 languages. Other titles include <em>The Cross of Christ, Understanding the Bible, The Contemporary Christian, Evangelical Truth, Issues Facing Christians Today, The Incomparable Christ, Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>Through the Bible Through the Year,</em> a daily devotional. He has also written eight volumes in <em>The Bible Speaks Today</em> series of New Testament expositions. Whether in the West or in the Two-Thirds World, a hallmark of Stott's ministry has been expository preaching that addresses the hearts and minds of contemporary men and women. Stott was honored by <em>Time</em> magazine in 2005 as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World" and was named in the Queen&#x2019;s New Years Honours list as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969, Stott founded the Langham Trust to fund scholarships for young evangelical leaders from the Majority World. He then founded the Evangelical Literature Trust, which provided books for students, pastors and theological libraries in the Majority World. These two trusts continued as independent charities until 2001, when they were joined as a single charity: the Langham Partnership. Langham's vision continues today to see churches in the Majority World equipped for mission and growing to maturity in Christ through nurturing national movements for biblical preaching, fostering the creation and distribution of evangelical literature, and enhancing evangelical theological education.This short classic is as much a response to Bertrand Russell's essay "Why I Am Not A Christian" as it is a clear statement of seminal Christian basics. Stott concisely reveals much of his life story while keeping the main theme in focus. Simon Vance captures the spirit of Stott's relationship with Christ and what brought him to it. The greater portion of the book hints at the deep thinking behind Stott's ruminations all while exhibiting humility towards his own ideas.

Mirelle loves her husband, Steve, but his intense, volatile personality exhausts her, as do his jealous, sometimes violent, tirades. Mirelle stoically endures these outbursts, although the caustic criticism she customarily receives from Steve's overbearing mother wears her down. The elder Mrs. Martin scorns Mirelle largely because she is the illegitimate daughter of a famous singer and the Hungarian painter Lajos Neagu. To placate her mother-in-law, Mirelle conceals her provocative heritage by refusing to seek widespread public attention for her sculptures. Such subservience always outraged her friend Lucy, who, before she died, exhorted Mirelle to be more assertive. Fortunately, the void Lucy left is suddenly filled by concert pianist James Howell, a lonely man who coaxes Mirelle to self-awareness, then falls in love with her. McCaffrey, best known for her science fiction fantasy , depicts Mirelle's predicament with sensitivity and credibility, and she perceptively delineates this troubled artist's creative temperament. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Semiotext(e) U.S.A.</h2><p>A massive outsider sci-fi anthology.

Nabhan (The Geography of Childhood, 1994, etc.), a research scientist at the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum and a MacArthur fellow, has for many years worked to promote the conservation of plants that are culturally and economically important to various indigenous peoples around the world. Many of these essays (most previously published in periodicals) touch on these plants and their use in human cultures. For example, Nabhan discusses the rise of diabetes among the O'odham people of Arizona following their shift from a diet based on native plants to one relying on processed, mass-produced foods; in another, he examines the possible downfall of Mexico's tequila industry, which now relies on a single agave (a kind of succulent) as a source of pulp, though there are dozens of varieties of agave plants. Nabhan writes of the sense of wonderment that comes from a knowledge of the natural world, and of the important work of learning what might be called ``natural literacy'' as a cultural skill. The best piece in the book indirectly addresses this last matter; in it, Nabhan decries the sterility of school playgrounds, which ``seem to squelch life rather than nurture it.'' Nabhan is not a particularly fluent writer, and he often strains for effect (in one not untypical passage, he writes of an ``all-female lizard species with reproductive habits more radical than anything in lesbian literature''). Many of Nabhan's pieces preach to a small choir. Nonetheless, the themes touched on are certain to be of interest to those readers concerned about environmental issues, especially worldwide biodiversity and its conservation. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reprint.</p><p>Stoker-winner Ketchum isn't known for novels dealing with the supernatural, but in this revised edition of a 1989 paperback, he demonstrates that this has nothing to do with lack of ability. Ketchum does here for Greece what Lovecraft did for New England and Stoker did for Transylvania, creating a landscape imbued with a numinous quality that's simultaneously beautiful and terrible. Jordan Chase owes his success as a businessman to his sensitivity to ancient sacred places. When he visits the tomb of Agamemnon, he experiences a prophetic vision. Simultaneously, an attractive but disturbed woman, Lelia, begins to insinuate herself into the lives of a group of tourists. At first her presence is merely disruptive, but it later becomes destructive. Unknown perhaps even to herself, Lelia has tapped into the mystical energy of Greece and has become an avatar of the goddess known variously as Selene, Artemis-and Hecate. When she dies accidentally, her full potential is unleashed as she strides forth, resurrected and transformed. Ketchum reveals a real understanding of the mysteries of Greek mythology, including the bloodthirstiness that Bullfinch underplayed, and he builds to a climax that's both logical and exciting. Fans of contemporary horror and of the classic supernatural novel will be pleased.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Germania: A Personal History of Germans Ancient and Modern</h2><p>&#39;It made me laugh so hard that I woke up my wife and had to give up reading the book in bed.

It is you, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend....&#34; Ps. 55:12-13 The paucity of resources for pastoral care of acquaintance-rape survivors highlights the invisibility of this growing crime and its largely uncharted pastoral challenges. In fact, most rape is by an acquaintance. Only 16 percent of such cases are reported; and, because they are difficult to prosecute, only 5 percent of those reported result in guilty verdicts. Focusing on the psychospiritual effects of this sexualized violence, Kristen Leslie offers the psychological and theological tools to religious professionals for understanding the deep spiritual trauma of the survivor and how best to work with her to reconstruct a personal world of meaning, trust, and faith. Based on extensive interviews with survivors, Leslie explains the personal and theological issues they raise, what they found helpful from religious professionals, the images and metaphors most germane to their trauma and recovery, and how they coped with or healed from the experience of rape. An exemplary and important study in practical theology, Leslie&#39;s volume will not only equip pastoral caregivers and counselors with specific guidelines. It will also enlighten them on the crucial role that theology can play in the re-construction of shattered lives.</p><p>A life-saving resource for pastoral care.Kristen J.

Historians have traditionally presented Jackson as a man who struggled to overcome the obstacles of his backwoods upbringing and helped create a more democratic United States. In his compelling new biography of Jackson, Mark R. Cheathem argues for a reassessment of these long-held views, suggesting that in fact "Old Hickory" lived as an elite southern gentleman. <br><br>Jackson grew up along the border between North Carolina and South Carolina, a district tied to Charleston, where the city's gentry engaged in the transatlantic marketplace. Jackson then moved to North Carolina, where he joined various political and kinship networks that provided him with entree into society. In fact, Cheathem contends, Jackson had already started to assume the characteristics of a southern gentleman by the time he arrived in Middle Tennessee in 1788.<br><br>After moving to Nashville, Jackson further ensconced himself in an exclusive social order by marrying the daughter of one of the city's cofounders, engaging in land speculation, and leading the state militia. Cheathem notes that through these ventures Jackson grew to own multiple plantations and cultivated them with the labor of almost two hundred slaves. His status also enabled him to build a military career focused on eradicating the nation's enemies, including Indians residing on land desired by white southerners. Jackson's military success eventually propelled him onto the national political stage in the 1820s, where he won two terms as president. Jackson's years as chief executive demonstrated the complexity of the expectations of elite white southern men, as he earned the approval of many white southerners by continuing to pursue Manifest Destiny and opposing the spread of abolitionism, yet earned their ire because of his efforts to fight nullification and the Second Bank of the United States.<br><br>By emphasizing Jackson's southern identity -- characterized by violence, honor, kinship, slavery, and Manifest Destiny -- Cheathem's narrative offers a bold new perspective on one of the nineteenth century's most renowned and controversial presidents.</p><p>Mark R. Cheathem is a professor of history at Cumberland University and the project director for the Papers of Martin Van Buren. He is the author or editor of several books, including&nbsp;<i>Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democrats</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Old Hickory's Nephew: The Political and Private Struggles of Andrew Jackson Donelson</i>."I heartily recommend his book. It is provocative in an admirable way, because it engages the attention of the scholar as well as the general reader. . . .

It is the most exciting book about Pluto you will ever read in your life.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jon Stewart</strong></p> When the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History reclassified Pluto as an icy comet, the <em>New York Times</em> proclaimed on page one, &#x201c;Pluto Not a Planet? Only in New York.&#x201d; Immediately, the public, professionals, and press were choosing sides over Pluto&#x2019;s planethood. Pluto is entrenched in our cultural and emotional view of the cosmos, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, award-winning author and director of the Rose Center, is on a quest to discover why. He stood at the heart of the controversy over Pluto&#x2019;s demotion, and consequently Plutophiles have freely shared their opinions with him, including endless hate mail from third-graders. With his inimitable wit, Tyson delivers a minihistory of planets, describes the oversized characters of the people who study them, and recounts how America's favorite planet was ousted from the cosmic hub. color throughout</p><p>Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History, director of its world-famous Hayden Planetarium, host of the hit radio and TV show StarTalk, and the New York Times best-selling author of Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.

Mirron Willis doesn&#39;t sound entirely comfortable with the scientific language (despite a number of credits as an actor and narrator in sci-fi), but he does a fine job conveying the audiobook&#39;s humor, including the letters from children who are angry that Tyson helped to demote their favorite planet.

The book introduces the Ego and describes Freud&#39;s theory of the unconscious. According to the creator of the psychoanalysis, a wish can be satisfied by an imaginary wish fulfillment. All dreams, even nightmares, are the fulfillment of such wishes.</p><p>Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>How Celtic Culture Invented Southern Literature</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Offers a lively, even combative, counter-thesis to many of the trite and possibly untrue notions about Southern writing.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Fred Chappell, North Carolina Poet Laureate 1997-2002</p> <p>&#x201c;An excellent aid in studying Southern literature in general, and the effects of Celtic cultural folkways in particular.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Stuart Ferry, President, Caledonian Society of Baton Rouge, Louisiana</p> <p>&#x201c;Indicative of the Celts&#x2019; newfound respectability in America.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Michael Newton, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p> <p>&#x201c;It will doubtless call for a re-examination of many prejudices.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;L'Observateur Book Review</p> <p>&#x201c;No serious college-level student of Southern literature should be without [it].&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;California Bookwatch, Midwest Book Review</p> <p>This seminal book of literary criticism challenges the common perception that the culture of white Southerners springs from English, or Anglo-Norman, roots.

Between 1920 and 1934, Gerald Brenan lived in the remote Spanish village of Yegen and South of Granada depicts his time there, vividly evoking the essence of his rural surroundings and the Spanish way of life before the Civil War. Here he portrays the landscapes, festivals and folk-lore of the Sierra Nevada, the rivalries, romances and courtship rituals, village customs, superstitions and characters. Fascinating details emerge, from cheap brothels to archaeological remains, along with visits from Brenan&#39;s friends from the Bloomsbury group - Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf among them. Knowledgeable, elegant and sympathetic, this is a rich account of Spain&#39;s vanished past. Gerald Brenan (1894-1987) was an English writer who spent much of his life in Spain. He is best known for The Spanish Labyrinth, a work of history on the background to the Spanish Civil War and for South From Granada: Seven Years in an Andalusian Village. He was awarded a CBE in 1982, and was much honoured in Spain If you enjoyed South from Granada, you might like Orwell&#39;s Homage to Catalonia, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;The best of Brenan&#39;s books: he has a true and proper knowledge of the culture he describes&#39; Cyril Connolly, Sunday Times &#39;A brilliant interpreter of Spain to the rest of the world&#39; The Times</p><p>Gerald Brenan (1894-1987) was an English writer who spent much of his life in Spain.

Quiet, pretty Mary Jago could never have suspected that a series of unspeakable murders in the park contained threads that tangled around her simple, ordinary life.</p><p>Discovering Ruth Rendell late must be like discovering Mozart late: any regrets for time wasted are overwhelmed by the pleasure of having so many treats to choose from. She writes mysteries about Inspector Wexford and suspense thrillers about what happens when people's lives accidently collide. This new book falls into the thriller category: in the first few pages we meet a large group of people living in and around London's Regents Park. There are the homeless, whose hardships are added to when a murderer begins to decimate their ranks; a barely-restrained lunatic who works as a dog-walker; a drug dealer and his violent helper; and Rendell's central character, Mary Jago, a gentle young woman whose courageous charity brings her lots of trouble. The best recent Wexford mystery is <b>Simisola</b>; other recommended Rendells include: <b>From Doon With Death</b>, <b>The Tree of Hands</b>, <b>An Unkindness of Ravens</b> and <b>The Brimstone Wedding</b> (written under her Barbara Vine alter ego).Ruth Rendell is the Queen of British crime writing. The author of over 50 novels, she has won many significant crime fiction awards. Her first novel, From Doon With Death, appeared in 1964, and since then her reputation and readership have grown steadily with each new book. She has received major awards for her work; three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America; the Crime Writers&#39; Gold Dagger Award for 1976&#39;s best crime novel, A Demon in My View; the Arts Council National Book Award for Genre Fiction in 1981 for The Lake of Darkness; the Crime Writer&#39;s Gold Dagger Award for 1986&#39;s best crime book for Live Flesh; in 1987 the Crime Writer&#39;s Gold Dagger Award for A Fatal Inversion and in 1991 the same award for King Solomon&#39;s Carpet, both written under the pseudonym Barbara Vine; the Sunday Times Literary Award in 1990; and in 1991 the Crime Writer&#39;s Cartier Diamond Award for outstanding contribution to the crime fiction genre. Her books are translated into 21 languages. In 1996 she was awarded the CBE and in 1997 became a Life Peer.</p><h2>Forbidden Dance, Book 1</h2><p>Aya Fujii is a high school student who eats, sleeps, and breathes ballet, but an accident during the National Competition causes an ankle injury for her that left her unable to dance for nearly a year. Although Aya recovers physically, she has not recovered psychologically. It isn&#39;t until she is invited to watch the performance of a small ballet troupe, called COOL, that Aya comes out of her funk. Now she has a new goal, to dance on stage with the charismatic leader of COOL: Akira Hibiya. However, since Akira has an incredibly strong presence and powerful charisma many girls have made such proclamations that have been ignored, thus Aya was labeled a fanatical fangirl and promptly escorted from the theater where the performance took place. As the story progresses Aya struggles to prove her worth as a ballet dancer and earn her place in COOL while struggling with more typical teenage concerns such as grades and her friends. While the main focus is Aya throughout the plot line the readers learn more about the backgrounds of most of the supporting characters. Aya herself is not left out of the character development as she refines her ballet technique and matures emotionally throughout the narrative.</p><p></p><h2>No Free Left: The Futures of Indian Communism</h2><p>Vijay Prashad has brought not the strains but the travails of the communist heartstrings to the public domain.

If dramatic changes in technology, commerce, and social relations are undermining familiar connections between culture and place, what happens to legacies of learning that put the nation at the center of the study of history, culture, language, politics, and geography? In short, what remains of American Studies? At a critical moment, this book offers a richly textured historical perspective on where our notions of national knowledge-and our sense of American Studies-have come from and where they may lead in a future of new ideas about culture and community. The America that seems to be disappearing before our very eyes is, George Lipsitz argues, actually the cumulative creation of yesterday's struggles over identity, culture, and power. With examples from statistics and history, poster designs and music lyrics, Lipsitz shows how American Studies has been shaped by the social movements of the 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s. His analysis reveals the sedimented history of social movement contestation contained in contemporary popular music, visual art, and cinema. <p>Finally, Lipsitz identifies the ways in which the globalization of commerce and culture are producing radically new understandings of politics, performance, consumption, knowledge, and nostalgia; the changing realities present not so much a danger as a clear challenge to a still-evolving American Studies-a challenge that this book helps us to confront wisely, flexibly, and effectively. </p><p>George Lipsitz is professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, San Diego, where he serves as director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute.

At the Art Institute of Chicago, for example, he famously relocated a bronze replica of an eighteenth-century sculpture of George Washington from the museum's entrance to an interior gallery, thereby highlighting the disjunction between the statue's symbolic function as a public monument and its aesthetic origins as an artwork.</p><p>Today, Asher is celebrated as one of the forerunners of institutional critique. Yet because of Asher's situation-based method of working, and his resistance to making objects that could circulate in the art market, few of his works survive in physical form. What does survive is writing by scholars and critics about his diverse practice. The essays in this volume document projects that range from Asher's environmental works and museum displacements to his research-based presentations and reflections on urban space.</p><p><b>Contributors</b><br>Michael Asher, Sandy Ballatore, Benjamin H.

In his encounters with books, Kazin shows us how great writing matters and how it involves us morally, socially, and personally on the deepest level. Whether reflecting on modernism, southern fiction, or black, Jewish, and New Yorker writing or reliving the work of Richard Wright, Saul Bellow, and John Cheever, he gives a penetrating, moving account of literature observed and lived. In his life as a critic, Kazin personifies the lesson that living and writing are necessarily intimate. </p><p> <i>Writing Was Everything</i> encapsulates the lively wit and authority of this timeless critic's unmistakable voice. It stands as clear testimony to Kazin's belief that "literature is not theory but, at best, the value we can give to our experience, which in our century has been and remains beyond the imagination of mankind." </p></p><p>New York Times Notable Book of 1995One of Kazin&#39;s great strengths as a critic is the sheer passion he brings to his task: from the beginning, his books have been hymns to the centrality of literature, its capacity, as he puts it in Writing Was Everything, to &#39;make the world shine&#39; ...

Wilson is a rare scientist: having over a long career made signal contributions to population genetics, evolutionary biology, entomology, and ethology, he has also steeped himself in philosophy, the humanities, and the social sciences. The result of his lifelong, wide-ranging investigations is <i>Consilience</i> (the word means "a jumping together," in this case of the many branches of human knowledge), a wonderfully broad study that encourages scholars to bridge the many gaps that yawn between and within the cultures of science and the arts. No such gaps should exist, Wilson maintains, for the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give understanding a purpose, to lend to us all "a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws." In making his synthetic argument, Wilson examines the ways (rightly and wrongly) in which science is done, puzzles over the postmodernist debates now sweeping academia, and proposes thought-provoking ideas about religion and human nature. He turns to the great evolutionary biologists and the scholars of the Enlightenment for case studies of science properly conducted, considers the life cycles of ants and mountain lions, and presses, again and again, for rigor and vigor to be brought to bear on our search for meaning. The time is right, he suggests, for us to understand more fully that quest for knowledge, for "<i>Homo sapiens</i>, the first truly free species, is about to decommission natural selection, the force that made us.... Soon we must look deep within ourselves and decide what we wish to become." Wilson's wisdom, eloquently expressed in the pages of this grand and lively summing-up, will be of much help in that search.An enormous intellectual adventure. In this groundbreaking new book, the American biologist Edward O. Wilson, considered to be one of the world&#39;s greatest living scientists, argues for the fundamental unity of all knowledge and the need to search for consilience--the proof that everything in our world is organized in terms of a small number of fundamental natural laws that comprise the principles underlying every branch of learning. Professor Wilson, the pioneer of sociobiology and biodiversity, now once again breaks out of the conventions of current thinking. He shows how and why our explosive rise in intellectual mastery of the truths of our universe has its roots in the ancient Greek concept of an intrinsic orderliness that governs our cosmos and the human species--a vision that found its apogee in the Age of Enlightenment, then gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. Drawing on the physical sciences and biology, anthropology, psychology, religion, philosophy, and the arts, Professor Wilson shows why the goals of the original Enlightenment are surging back to life, why they are reappearing on the very frontiers of science and humanistic scholarship, and how they are beginning to sketch themselves as the blueprint of our world as it most profoundly, elegantly, and excitingly is.</p><h2>St. Louis Lost: Uncovering the City&#39;s Architectural Treasures</h2><p>From the homes of the founders of St. Louis to a list of endangered structures that are fresh in today's news -- such as Cupples Station and the Arena -- <i>St. Louis Lost</i> author Mary Bartley tells an entertaining and instructive tale of St. Louis landmarks forever lost to the wrecking ball. The book visits many parts of the metropolitan area, from south St. Louis to the Central West End, to north St. Louis city and county. Based on a series of columns first published in the West End Word newspaper, <i>St. Louis Lost</i> recounts the stories of many lost buildings, their inhabitants and their times. The book begins with the city's early development along the Mississippi River. As the city grew rapidly in the 1800s, buildings rose and fell, and the book traces the past of many downtown landmarks. The movement of the city's private places steadily west from downtown is described, including the grand mansions and opulent lifestyles of the city's wealthy. Many of the city's past educational and religious structures are included, as are Sportsman's Park and the narrow gauge railroad in north St. Louis county. Woven into the architectural detail is the story of the people behind the walls, the lives of some of St. Louis' most prominent -- and most infamous -- citizens. Finally, the book reminds us that today's leaders, and those who follow, need to know and appreciate the history of their cities and their historic buildings as they plan the future of 21st-century metropolitan areas.</p><p><i>St. Louis Lost</i> contains more than 100 images of historic buildings.Gone But Not Forgotten...

As his investigation gathers pace this atmospheric classic detective story becomes a thrilling game of legal cat and mouse.</p><p>Born in 1913, in a town on the shores of Lake Maggiore in Northern Italy, Piero Chiara worked as a court employee until the outbreak of Word War Two. When the Fascist authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 1944 he fled to Switzerland, where his first work of literature, a collection of poetry entitled <i>Incantavi</i>, was published in 1945. After the war he returned to Italy, and became one of the most celebrated writers of the post-war period. The winner of more than a dozen literary prizes - including the 1964 Campiello and the 1979 Bancarello - he is widely read and studied in his home country, and his stories and novels have been adapted for both television and film. Piero Chiara died in 1986. <i>The Disappearance of Signora Guilia</i> is his first book to be translated into English.'One of the best detective stories ever written in Italy... enriched by a recognisable portrait of human weakness, and characters who remain long in the reader' s memory' -&nbsp;<b>Renzo Montagnoli&nbsp;</b><br><br>'Until the final pages, the reader devours the book with a hunger provoked only by the finest books and authors.

Reprint.</p><p>Manhattan ADA Butch Karp returns in this fifteenth outing in Robert Tanenbaum's popular series--this time he's the hunted as well as the hunter, and he's being stalked by a man he sent to prison over a decade ago--a psychopath who supposedly died in prison. But Felix Tighe is very much alive, and now he's the paid assassin of a group of Islamic fundamentalists whose terrorist goals will make 9/11 look like a training exercise. Tighe has his own violent score to settle with Karp, his estranged wife Marlene, and their three children--particularly Lucy, who's no stranger to demons like Felix. Tanenbaum's plotting is confident and his pacing assured--he's a master of the legal thriller, as good if not better than Grisham and his peers, and he works from an insider's knowledge of Manhattan's criminal justice milieu. But what makes this series remarkable is the author's ability to keep his characters fresh and interesting by putting them in circumstances that reveal more of their emotional, spiritual and marital dimensions with every new adventure. <i>Resolved</i> is a terrific read. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Robert K.

Joseph Patrick Riley Jr., just 32 at the time, promised to make Charleston an inclusive city, heal the lingering wounds of the civil rights movement, stem the rising crime rate and open more public parks. Over the next 40 years, Riley led the city through disasters and divisiveness, tragedy and triumph, all the while transforming Charleston from a sleepy Southern town devastated by civil war into one of the most vibrant, fastest-growing cities in the nation - and the most popular tourist destination in the world. He rebuilt Charleston after a devastating hurricane nearly destroyed the city. And in his final months in office, Riley led the city through a tragedy that threatened to destroy the peace and harmony he had worked toward his entire life.

Will Blythe, a contributing editor to <i>Harper's</i> and <i>Mirabella</i> and formerly the literary editor at <i>Esquire</i>, has assembled a fine cast of 26 contemporary fiction writers to muse on his assigned topic, "Why I Write." The reasons, boiled down, range from "Because I can't do anything else" to "Because I can't not write." Ho-hum. But these are fiction writers, don't forget, and fiction writers can spin yarns.<p> Thom Jones's (<i>The Pugilist at Rest</i>, <i>Cold Snap</i>) formation as a writer began, perhaps, during lunch hours spent drawing sharp-witted comics in the principal's office at a Lutheran elementary school. A promising start at the Iowa writing program dead-ended, seemingly, with drunken night shifts as a school janitor. Only an epiphany involving Wile E. Coyote drew him back to writing. Before long, he'd sold three stories in one afternoon, to <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, and the <i>New Yorker</i>. "Fiction writers often mature at a glacial pace," says Jones. " I was slower than most."</p><p> With apparent effortlessness, Elizabeth Gilbert (<i>Pilgrims</i>) weaves together tales of a cursing cowboy, her grade-school diary, a gawky teenager who aspired to be a magician, and a man whose neighbors had stolen his cat. "Sometimes," says Gilbert modestly, "when we are trying to find a calling, it is helpful to confirm that we are not really very good at anything else." Gilbert, it is clear, has found her calling. And Mark Richard (<i>The Ice at the Bottom of the World</i>, <i>Fishboy</i>) tells a sprawling mini-saga about a "special child" whose life is so full of the elements of good fiction (a scorpion-infested sandbox, a homesick mother, a father who accidentally lit a borrowed bulldozer on fire, a mean tomcat named Mr. Priss, a family friend who got shredded in a silage bin) that you can't imagine him not becoming a fiction writer. Also: Lee Smith, Pat Conroy, David Foster Wallace, Tom Chiarella, Jayne Anne Phillips, and others. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>To pursue a vocation like fiction writing these days demands an almost religious sense of mission. With so little chance of making a living, let alone a fortune, how does one come to terms with the impulse to write?

This is his first trade book. Christine Gross-Loh has written for the Wall Street Journal, the Atlantic and the Huffington Post. She has a PhD in East Asian history from Harvard and is the author of Parenting without Borders.I couldn&#39;t wait for this. Brilliant. This is where it&#39;s at now . . . so fascinating * Jeremy Vine, BBC Radio 2 * I can&#39;t think of anyone who wouldn&#39;t benefit from reading The Path, from my youngest son to the future President of the USA. It&#39;s accessible, realistic and far from being an ordinary self-help book. It gives immediate reassurance that this chaotic life can be mastered and it challenges you to strive for better -- Patrick Neale * Bookseller * Very good. Based on Puett&#39;s popular class at Harvard, it&#39;s a great introduction to Eastern philosophy, which I always chide myself for not studying enough -- Ryan Holiday The Path is very interesting . . . makes you want to read further -- Nigel Warburton The Path is in part a pleasing debunking of fashionable self-help disciplines . . . I can testify that Puett is one of the nicest people - if not the nicest person - I have ever interviewed: attentive, generous and patient -- Tim Dowling * Guardian * I have been talking about it to everyone. It&#39;s brilliant, mesmerizing, profound - and deeply contrarian. It points the way to a life of genuine fulfillment and meaning -- Amy Chua, author of &#39;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&#39; I couldn&#39;t wait for this. Brilliant. This is where it&#39;s at now ... so fascinating * Jeremy Vine, BBC Radio 2 * Can you turn a Chinese theory class into a smart self-help book? US academic Michael Puett did. Puett&#39;s book encourages us to chuck away our stiff, encrusted western notions, and to adopt a more fluid, less didactic approach to life. The Path is not your classic self-help book, and not just because it dismantles the self. It doesn&#39;t serve up an easy set of how-to activities ... you are also advised that any changes you make will be slow, incremental, the result of constant daily work ... To talk to Puett is to view our western tradition through an entirely different lens * Sunday Times * A new book from a cult Harvard professor turns contemporary thinking around happiness on its head...There can&#39;t be many cult professors. Especially ones that lecture Chinese philosophy to undergraduates. But Professor Michael Puett of Harvard is one of them. Via word of mouth, his courses became full. And now he&#39;s written a book, with co-author and journalist Christine Gross-Loh, based on his course. The Path looks at the teachings of ancient Chinese philosophers and explains how we can apply these largely forgotten teachings to our everyday lives. Granted, it sounds like a tough read. It sounds specialist and niche and intimidating. It sounds all of those things. But it is none of those things. It&#39;s a big ask in under 200 pages. But there&#39;s something wonderfully simple and refreshing about the ideas. There is a simplicity to this book: all we have is ourselves, let&#39;s try and make things better -- Marisa Bate * The Pool * His course has become the most popular on campus, even with those studying other subjects, and that&#39;s because he talks about how to have a good life, and using ancient Chinese philosophy challenges all our modern assumptions about what it takes to flourish in life -- Sarah Montague * Today programme * A worthy introduction to thinkers rarely taught in British universities -- Matthew Syed * The Times * It&#39;s on my night stand -- Gwyneth Paltrow Offer[s] interesting alternatives to some of our modern ideas of self and society ... worth the cover price * Financial Times * Ideas in this book ... authentically contradict modern common sense ... Noting the current fad for mindfulness, the authors point out that Buddhism in the west &#34;has often been distorted as a way of looking within and embracing the self&#34;. Such navel-gazing, they and the Chinese sages agree, may be a kind of imprisonment -- Steven Poole * Guardian * A very accessible and inspiring piece of work ... Anyone willing to put the work in might find that this book really can change your life * The Sentinel * This book is a revelation, a practical way through a fractured, distracting world. I thought I knew these philosophers - and I was wrong. Rigorous, concise, deeply informed, The Path retires our facile shorthand about ideas &#34;from the East&#34; and presents a powerful intellectual case to engage, to care, and to remember -- Evan Osnos This is a book that turns the notion of help - and the self, for that matter - on its head. Puett and Gross-Loh bring seemingly esoteric concepts down to Earth, where we can see them more clearly. The result is a philosophy book grounded in the here and now, and brimming with nuggets of insight. No fortune-cookie this, The Path serves up a buffet of meaty life lessons. I found myself reading and re-reading sections, letting the wisdom steep like a good cup of tea -- Eric Weiner The Path will not only change your life - -it will change the way you see history and the world. From its wondrously fresh take on Confucius to its quietly profound read of just what it is the great sages have to say to us, this book exemplifies all that can come of the radical openness of Chinese philosophy. Read it and be transformed -- Gish Jen, author of Tiger Writing and The Love Wife The Path illuminates a little-known spiritual and intellectual landscape: the rich body of Chinese thought that, starting more than two millennia ago, charted new approaches to living a meaningful life. But Puett goes a lot further, creatively applying this ancient thought to the dilemmas of modern life. The result is a fresh recipe for harnessing our natural energies and emotions to strengthen social connection and build islands of order amid the chaos that sometimes surrounds us -- Robert Wright, author of The Language of God Puett&#39;s dynamism translates well from his classroom theater onto the page, and his provocative, radical re-envisioning of everyday living through Chinese philosophy opens wide the &#39;possibilities for thinking afresh about ourselves and about our future.&#39; With its ... spirited, convincing vision, revolutionary new insights can be gleaned from this book on how to approach life&#39;s multifarious situations with both heart and head * Kirkus Reviews * If you&#39;re looking to get out of a rut, or rise above the doom and gloom of our present global situation, Puett&#39;s channeled knowledge from the Chinese masters will be a wake-up call. We sometimes forget that our problems are as old as civilization, and maybe the answers have always been hidden in plain sight. * Publishers Weekly Staff Pick * The Laozi actually offers a much more expansive-and revolutionary-vision of innovation [than The Art of War. It] questions the very idea that we should try to come up with innovative strategies within a defined, predictable arena, whether that is the battlefield or dinner table, the boardroom or the steel industry. Instead, the Laozi assumes a world in constant flux and motion. Those who aspire to innovate are better off seeing the world through a Laozian, not Sunzian, lens * Fortune * A very accessible work * i * There&#39;s a lot in it...fascinating.

In <i>Margaret Powell's Cookery Book</i>, she gives readers a closer look at the world inside the vast kitchens of these great houses. It's an eye-opening and mouthwatering snapshot of that world. The upstairs dining room always demanded the best of Continental cuisine and, cooking downstairs, Margaret Powell obliged. Her cookery book is a firsthand account of the way people cooked and dined in the early twentieth century when houses like those in "Upstairs, Downstairs" and "Downton Abbey" were fully staffed and running like clockwork. Describing kitchen equipment such as the black ranges that had to be shined daily, the fancy moulds that needed screen covers to keep out the flies and tubs of ice that were used instead of refrigerators, she tells readers just how big a job it was to keep the upstairs dining table abundantly filled. Giving away the secrets of the manor, she presents more than 500 recipes, from the simple to the sophisticated. Divided into chapters such as Hors d'oeuvre, Soups, Fish, Entrees, Roasts and Meat Dishes , Savouries, Puddings and others, she shows readers today what it was like to eat well, if you were a member of England's upper class. Classic, but simple, dishes such as Shepherd's Pie and Roast Chicken Stuffed with Herbs alternate with sophisticated fare and long-lost recipes like Potatoes a la Florence, Rabbit Pilau, Compote of Snipe, Sardines a la Bombay and Queen Mab Pudding. With her trademark wit and gimlet eye, she tells readers what it was like to cook for her "betters" but she also states one thing proudly--"Food is more than just food. I like it be prepared and cooked well, and I like trouble taken over it." Behind every well-fed family like the Crawleys of "Downton Abbey" or the Bellamys of "Upstairs, Downstairs" was a cook like Margaret Powell and, now, she invites readers everywhere to the feast.</p></p><p><p>MARGARET POWELL was born in 1907 in Hove, and left school at the age of 13 to start working. At 14, she got a job in a hotel laundry room, and a year later went into service as a kitchen maid, eventually progressing to the position of cook, before marrying a milkman called Albert. In 1968 the first volume of her memoirs, <i>Below Stairs</i>, was published to instant success and turned her into a celebrity. She died in 1984.</p><b>Margaret Powell's Cookery Book</b><br><b>1</b><b>LEARNING TO COOK</b>Lots of girls nowadays by the time that they get married know a great deal about cooking, because their mothers have let them learn it at home. Today people have got more money and can experiment, but when I was a girl money was so tight and food was so precious that my mother couldn't possibly let me practise at cooking. I used to peel the vegetables and do other odd jobs for her, but that was all. I'd get upset about it because I would have loved to make pastries and cakes. I was always anxious to learn. I knew that other mothers let their daughters cook and I thought Mum was being unkind. When you're young you don't really understand about the shortage of money.So it was that when I went into domestic service as a kitchen maid at the age of fifteen, I knew nothing about cooking at all. This surprised the cook. She was a Scot, and she told me that up there no mother would dream of bringing up a daughter without instructing her in the rudiments of cooking from a very early age, but she was quite kindly. 'Well, gal,' she said when I joined her, 'you're going to have to begin at the beginning. It may be no bad thing at that. At least you'll learn to do things my way. Just keep your eyes and ears open and do as I do or as I tell you.'The first thing I learnt was the utensils that she used and what she used them for: the knives, saucepans and the different kinds of basins and casseroles, the dishes and pie-dishes.For instance, with pans: for sauces, and especially a sauce that had to be left on the heat, you choose one with a heavy base because sauces, by their very nature, can burn easily.The size of a dish shouldn't be a matter of speculation. You must choose, for instance, a casserole dish that is large enough to contain all the ingredients that you are going to use, and it's important when you are making a souffl� to ensure that the dish is going to be high enough when the souffl� rises.One of the first things I did in a practical way was to learn how to prepare vegetables. At home we were very rough and ready. I would take as little of the peel off the potatoes as possible because we needed to economize. I didn't bother about making them look perfectly round in shape or removing every piece of peel, and we cooked all the cabbage, including the stalk, to make it go as far as possible, but in this kitchen none of the outside leaves was used and every leaf was pulled from the stalk. The same with spinach: when my mother cooked spinach she would wash it once and then put the whole lot in. I didn't know that you had to pull off the stalk, wash what was left three or four times at least, and cook it in the smallest amount of water.Again, at home I'd only seen potatoes done three ways: roasted, boiled or mashed. I was astonished when I found the variety of methods there were of preparing them.Asparagus I'd seen in shops but I'd never handled it. I didn't know that you had to scrape the bottom off each stick, put it into water with a dash of lemon to keep the bottom of the stalks white and then put another dash of lemon juice in the water when you cooked it.There were (apart from asparagus) vegetables which wereunknown to me. Things like artichokes: the Jerusalem ones were the foulest possible things to peel, and the other kind, the globe artichokes. I could never understand why they were both called artichokes, because two more dissimilar vegetables I'd never seen, and when I discovered the small amount that people ate of globe artichokes, I just felt they were a waste of money, but I still had to find out how to prepare them. When the cook asked me whether I knew how to cook vegetables and I said, 'I have a rough idea,' I didn't realize how truthful I was being.The elementary rules I learned about cooking were that many vegetables are enhanced by adding butter or cream, and that they can be ruined by bad cooking just as easily as any of the more expensive dishes. When she felt I'd learnt the rudiments of preparing and cooking vegetables, the cook showed me how to prepare birds for the table. In this particular place we used to have game sent down from Scotland: grouse, partridge and pheasant. All of which was, of course, new to me. The only bird we had at home was a chicken for Christmas.Of course, I didn't know game had to be hung, unplucked and undrawn, with a hook through the head on a rail in the passage. Sometimes the birds hung there so long that I'd come down and find the heads on the hook and the bodies on the floor. Then the cook would say that they were ready. Plucking them had to be done with great care, because if you pulled the feathers the wrong way you broke the skin. I watched the cook do the first one. I've never seen anyone pluck a bird as quickly as she could. The feathers simply flew. Then I had to learn to gut them, pull the insides out. It was a horrible job, but I had to know how to do it, and finally how to singe them by holding them over the fire.After this I was initiated into the rites of preparing fish. Often the fish were delivered to the door in a bucket alive, so I had to kill the poor things first. I didn't know where the vulnerable partof the fish was, but after one flapped up just as I was cutting its head off and scratched my nose, I became very wary of them. I used to get the heavy iron poker from the kitchen range and hit them about the head with it. I don't suggest that you do this today. Anyway, fish don't come like that any more. Cook showed me how to prepare fish: how to cut off the fins without cutting into the body, how to remove the head and clean the inside, how to get the black skin off without breaking the flesh and how to fillet. My first efforts weren't always successful, but I learned by trial and error, and when I made errors, that particular fish was given to the servants to eat.The main thing is to have the right kind of knife. Any old knife won't do, and, like all knives, the one used should be kept very sharp. We had a man round every month to do ours.Then I had to start preparing the meals for the other servants. The cook showed me how to prepare and cook beef that wasn't of the best quality, because naturally we servants didn't have rump or fillet steak. She used to soak it in vinegar and water: the quantity was about one gill of vinegar to one quart of water. It would soak for three or four hours, and this made it tender. Then it was cut up and placed in the dish and water added, barely covering the meat. It was put in the slowest part of the oven and left for an hour and a half before being covered with pastry. She showed me how to flavour it with herbs, rubbing them between the hands until they were fine powder. They weren't powdered in advance because that way they seemed to lose their flavour.Most that I learned, though, came from taking the cook's advice to keep my eyes and ears open. As my mother and grandmother told me, very few cooks would explain to a kitchen maid how they made particular dishes. Not because it was a big secret, but with seven or eight people to cook for upstairs, they couldn't be bothered, and no doubt they thought that, as they'd had tolearn as they went along, you'd have to do the same. Mind you, I chose my moments, and those moments were generally when the cook had to sit down to do a particular job. She would tell me then.I remember once when she was making a sponge with just eggs, sugar and flour - no butter. I said, 'Why do you have to sit and beat that for twenty minutes with just a wire whisk?' She explained to me that it was to get as much air as possible into the mixture; that it was the air that made it rise. I'd thought it was just to mix the eggs with the sugar. But if it was an intricate dish I couldn't get anything out of her. So I used to watch. Fortunately, I was blessed with a very good memory, and when I got to my bedroom at night I used to jot down the things I'd seen her do. I didn't always know the proportions, but I learned these later by trial and error.By the time I left my first place I had a whole notebook filled with dishes. The under-housemaid who I shared a room with used to say, 'I can't see why you bother, you don't get paid any extra, sitting up half the night writing things out.' But when you're an under-housemaid the jobs are just routine; except for the basic things, cooking isn't.Another thing that helped me was that in one place where I was a cook they used to give a lot of dinner parties with certain special dishes, and the madam would engage a chef to come in and cook these in my kitchen. After we'd served 'them' upstairs, the chef, the butler, myself and the head parlour maid would have our meal afterwards. The drinks would be brought out and the chef would begin to get mellow. Then I'd start to butter him up, flatter him and give him all the old flannel. I'd say that never in my life had I seen such a marvellous dish, and how I would love to be able to make it, but of course it was beyond the powers of poor little me. He would say, 'Oh, it's not as hard as all that.' ThenI'd ask him how he got a certain texture, and gradually, bit by bit, by the end of the evening I'd have got the recipe out of him.Another thing I learned as I moved around was that cooks have different methods of doing things. In my first place, for instance, we never had such a thing as a tammy cloth, so that in my second place as kitchen maid, when cook said to me she was making a clear soup, get the tammy cloth out, I didn't know what she meant. 'Huh, fine sort of cook you must have had back at your last place,' she said. It appeared that a tammy cloth was a large piece of fine woollen material, and if you were making either clear soup or a pur�e, you emptied the mixture into it with a person at each end, and they then twisted the cloth in opposite directions so that the soup or pur�e would ooze out through it. I must say I tho...</p><h2>Graphic Guide to Frame Construction: Details for Builders and Designers (For Pros By Pros)</h2><p><p>A classic reference, the <em>Graphic Guide to Frame Construction</em> is a comprehensive visual handbook filled with hundreds of meticulous drawings showing the framing details you need to understand when building with wood.

Stafford uses simple, formal, passionate language; less-practiced readers will have to wrestle with some of his imagery ("Coyotes are circling around our truth"; "We bow, and/the voice that falls through the rapids/calls all the rocks by their secret names"), but most ideas and feelings are insightful and expressed clearly ("The world looks/tame, but it might go wild, any time"). Though the poet writes with almost unbearable poignancy about death, his ultimate message is a celebratory one: "...you're not alone./The whole wide world pours down."

Near his house in Virginia, he happened to encounter people who reenact the Civil War--men who dress up in period costumes and live as Johnny Rebs and Billy Yanks. Intrigued, he wound up having some odd adventures with the "hardcores," the fellows who try to immerse themselves in the war, hoping to get what they lovingly term a "period rush." Horwitz spent two years reporting on why Americans are still so obsessed with the war, and the ways in which it resonates today. In the course of his work, he made a sobering side trip to cover a murder that was provoked by the display of the Confederate flag, and he spoke to a number of people seeking to honor their ancestors who fought for the Confederacy. Horwitz has a flair for odd details that spark insights, and <i>Confederates in the Attic</i> is a thoughtful and entertaining book that does much to explain America's continuing obsession with the Civil War."The freshest book about divisiveness in America that I have read in some time. This splendid commemoration of the war and its legacy . . . is an eyes-open, humorously no-nonsense survey of complicated Americans." <br>--Roy Blount Jr., New York Times Book Review <br> <br>"In this sparkling book Horwitz explores some of our culture's myths with the irreverent glee of a small boy hurling snowballs at a beaver hat. . . . An important contribution to understanding how echoes of the Civil War have never stopped." <br>--USA Today <br> <br>Horwitz's chronicle of his odyssey through the nether and ethereal worlds of Confederatemania is by turns amusing, chilling, poignant, and always fascinating. He has found the Lost Cause and lived to tell the tale a wonderfully piquant tale of hardcore reenactors, Scarlett O'Hara look-alikes, and people who reshape Civil War history to suit the way they wish it had come out. If you want to know why the war isn't over yet in the South, read Confederates in the Attic to find out. <br>--James McPherson, author of Battle Cry of Freedom <br> <br> <br>The enthusiasm, opinions, and beliefs of latter-day Confederates don't get much mainstream exposure these days, but Tony Horwitz portrays them with accuracy, humor, and respect. This is a serious book on a serious subject, but it often made me laugh out loud. Like some characters from a Walker Percy novel, Horwitz keeps finding himself in utterly absurd settings, with colorful, even bizarre, companions. <br> --John Shelton Reed, author of Whistling Dixie: Dispatches from the South <br> <br></p><h2>Rag and Bone</h2><p>While recovering from a heart attack, gay Mexican-American attorney Henry Rios comes to the aid of his long-lost niece, the illegitimate daughter of his estranged sister, who has confessed to the murder of her abusive husband, but during his investigation, Rios discovers that things are more complicated than he had thought. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>The good news is that Henry Rios, the hero of several of Michael Nava's earlier thrillers (<i>The Death of Friends</i>, <i>The Burning Plain</i>) is back. The bad news, spelled out in the acknowledgments, is that "this book brings to an end this series of mysteries and my career as a mystery writer." If this is your first exposure to the author or his hero, you'll be as sorry to read the end note as Nava's justly deserved fan club. <p> Rios, a gay Hispanic lawyer, has been described as an "outsider" hero, dedicated to finding justice in a world where it seems to be a highly perishable commodity. His keen intelligence is matched by his vulnerability, in this case to the emotional demands placed on him by a sudden heart attack that leaves him wondering whether life is still worth living, and the news that his sister, a former nun, once had a daughter, who has been found and then lost again. Tracing Vicky and her 10-year-old son Angel isn't that difficult for Henry. An abused woman hiding from a violent ex-husband doesn't have that many ways to disappear. But there's something about Vicky that doesn't fit the abuse profile, and when she's charged with killing Angel's father, Henry is torn between his desire to free her and his sense that there's more to the story than she's telling him. There is, of course, but it's the multidimensionality of his central characters rather than the mysteries they're caught up in that drive Nava's perceptive, brilliantly explicated novels. Love in its many guises drives this one--love between Henry and John, the first man to touch Rios's heart in many years, and love for Angel, the nephew in whom he sees a chance to redeem his own unhappy childhood. Nava leaves his series hero in their good hands, with a new career as a judge ahead of him. And he leaves his devoted readers hoping he'll change his mind and bring Henry back again, perhaps this time from the bench instead of the bar. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Michael Nava's award-winning novels also include <i>The Little Death</i>, <i>Goldenboy</i>, <i>How Town</i>, <i>The Hidden Law</i>, <i>The Death of Friends</i>, and <i>The Burning Plain</i>.

Not everybody knows in the Thirties that there existed a French version high class car - the HISPANO SUIZA. The word means &#34;SPAIN-SWITZERLAND&#34;, stemming from the two founder&#39;s nationality - namely J. Castro, the Spanish entrepreneur and the Swiss engineer Marc Birkigt. From the beginning all cars carried an emblem on the cooler incorporating the Spanish and Swiss Coat of Arms. 1904 Castro and Birkigt formed the company HISPANO SUIZA in Barcelona and produced cars of different sizes which won quickly the reputation of the experts and the nobility who purchased many of their products. It turned out, however, that the French market was much bigger for high class motorcars and consequently a factory was set up in France - near Paris. A turning point in the development of the company was the outbreak of World War I. Birkigt designed quickly a novel water cooled aircraft engine which outperformed subsequently all their competitors, particularly when it comes to endurance. The HISPANO SUIZA engine became a legend and the emblem of one of the most famous French pilots, Georges Guynemer - a flying stork - became the emblem of HISPANO SUIZA. After the war, Birkigt turned back to luxury cars again and created some of the most advanced cars of this time - all ordered individually by the richest of the time, produced fully hand crafted whereby the body of the car was always made by a coach-building company in accordance with the specifications of the customer. Consequently, there are no two identical cars of HISPANO SUIZA in the world. Rolls Royce took over some technical features from HISPANO SUIZA under a licence agreement but never reached the performance of HISPANO SUIZA. H-S was considered to be the top brand among all luxury cars and certainly the most expensive as well.</p><p></p><h2>Balance in Movement: How to Achieve the Perfect Seat</h2><p>An updated edition of a groundbreaking book that helps readers understand the anatomical requirements crucial for establishing the perfect seat.</p><p><b>Susanne von Dietze</b> is a physiotherapist, riding instructor, and active dressage competitor.

The two continue their back-and-forth exchange as Kitty Cat dilly-dallies and Mother urges her through each step of the morning routine and gets her off to school.

Kitty Cat is the star of her own show, romping across the pages, knowing that she will eventually get to where she needs to be. There is never a sense of urgency on Mother's part, either, which makes the final line "Kitty Cat, Kitty Cat, now we have to go!/Okay, Mother, I'm sorry I'm so slow" seem like an unexpected chastisement. The accompanying picture of mother and daughter sharing a warm hug helps to defuse the negativity.

This delightfully comic rhyming book sets the struggle in a cat household, with one adorably recalcitrant kitten reenacting actions that engender the parental response, how can this be taking so long? For every hurry-up directive the mother cat gives, the kitten has one refrain: "Just a second Mother." Readers see the kitten snuggling on the pillow, standing on its head in bed, tearing apart the bedroom in search of socks, discovering and chasing a mouse. All is mayhem and panic. A tiny mouse serves as an interested observer in each watercolor, until he becomes prey, and then a very relieved escapee, as the kitten is finally swept off to school. Children should enjoy this recasting of their own getting-ready sagas. --Booklist, July 2008</p></p><h2>Annie and Moon: A Story</h2><p>Her little black cat Moon gives Annie feelings of security and affection during a series of moves with her mother</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2-- First published in New Zealand, this is the story of Annie, a child of a single mother, who is uprooted four times during her young life. Luckily, she has the company of her pet cat, Moon, to ease her through the tough times. The refrain, "It isn't easy for a little cat to get used to a new home," is a soothing chant for Annie and for sympathetic readers as well. The full-color illustrations reveal the various crowded lifestyles and the unpleasantness that Annie, her mother, and her cat tolerate until they finally find a comfortable home with Annie's grandmother. The straightforward text conveys the emotions of relocating and adjusting to change. A reassuring work that might find a place in collections for its bibliotherapeutic value. --Marianne Pilla, Upper Dublin Public Library, Dresher, PA<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Under Rainbow</h2><p>Originally pulbished in 1977, unavailable for more than a decade, Karnowitz&#39;s Under the Rainbow is one of the few genuine gay classics.

Among his many prizes and citations are the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award, the Carnegie Medal, the BSFA Award, eight honorary doctorates and, of course, a knighthood. In 2012, he won a BAFTA for his documentary on the subject of assisted suicide, &#39;Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die&#39;. He is the author of fifty bestselling books but is best known for the globally renowned Discworld series. The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983, and the series is still going strong almost three decades later. Four Discworld novels - Hogfather, Going Postal, The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic - have been adapted for television, with more to follow. His books have sold approximately 85 million copies worldwide (but who&#39;s counting?), and been translated into thirty-seven languages. In 2007, Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. He died in 2015.The latest in Pratchett's Discworld series plays a variation on the Faust theme. Eric is a singularly inept sorcerer who conjures up an even more inept wizard, Rincewind, and a sentient (also treacherous, vindictive, and unruly) footlocker named, of course, the Luggage. Not having got anything like what he bargained for, Eric is fated to go through the usual zany ordeals of a Pratchett protagonist, until he wishes he'd never been born. Nor do things really all work out in the end, even if Eric is better off than he expected to be through most of the book. The Discworld books are building a following that is beginning to resemble that of Piers Anthony's Xanth stories, although it can be said that Pratchett is rather more sophisticated than Anthony. In any case, there should be a lot of readers for this one. Fantasy collections, provide accordingly. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Crafting Springtime Gifts: 25 Adorable Projects Featuring Bunnies, Chicks, Lambs &amp; Other Springtime Favorites</h2><p>Lambs, bunnies, geese oh my!

If the first reports are to be believed, Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived. The distinction, if one can call it that, of being the last human whose birth was officially recorded, unrelated as it was to any personal virtue or talent, had always been difficult for him to handle. And now he is dead. The news was given to us here in Britain on the nine o&#x2019;clock programme of the State Radio Service and I heard it fortuitously. I had settled down to begin this diary of the last half of my life when I noticed the time and thought I might as well catch the headlines to the nine o&#x2019;clock bulletin. Ricardo&#x2019;s death was the last item mentioned, and then only briefly, a couple of sentences delivered without emphasis in the newscaster&#x2019;s carefully non-committal voice. But it seemed to me, hearing it, that it was a small additional justification for beginning the diary today; the first day of a new year and my fiftieth birthday. As a child I had always liked that distinction, despite the inconvenience of having it follow Christmas too quickly so that one present &#x2013; it never seemed notably superior to the one I would in any case have received &#x2013; had to do for both celebrations.<br><br>As I begin writing, the three events, the New Year, my fiftieth birthday, Ricardo&#x2019;s death, hardly justify sullying the first pages of this new loose-leaf notebook. But I shall continue, one small additional defence against personal accidie. If there is nothing to record, I shall record the nothingness and then if, and when, I reach old age &#x2013; as most of us can expect to, we have become experts at prolonging life &#x2013; I shall open one of my tins of hoarded matches and light my small personal bonfire of vanities. I have no intention of leaving the diary as a record of one man&#x2019;s last years. Even in my most egotistical moods I am not as self-deceiving as that. What possible interest can there be in the journal of Theodore Faron, Doctor of Philosophy, Fellow of Merton College in the University of Oxford, historian of the Victorian age, divorced, childless, solitary, whose only claim to notice is that he is cousin to Xan Lyppiatt, the dictator and Warden of England. No additional personal record is, in any case, necessary. All over the world nation states are preparing to store their testimony for the posterity which we can still occasionally convince ourselves may follow us, those creatures from another planet who may land on this green wilderness and ask what kind of sentient life once inhabited it. We are storing our books and manuscripts, the great paintings, the musical scores and instruments, the artefacts. The world&#x2019;s greatest libraries will in forty years&#x2019; time at most be darkened and sealed. The buildings, those that are still standing, will speak for themselves. The soft stone of Oxford is unlikely to survive more than a couple of centuries. Already the University is arguing about whether it is worth refacing the crumbling Sheldonian. But I like to think of those mythical creatures landing in St. Peter&#x2019;s Square and entering the great Basilica, silent and echoing under the centuries of dust. Will they realize that this was once the greatest of man&#x2019;s temples to one of his many gods? Will they be curious about his nature, this deity who was worshipped with such pomp and splendour, intrigued by the mystery of his symbol, at once so simple, the two crossed sticks, ubiquitous in nature, yet laden with gold, gloriously jewelled and adorned? Or will their values and their thought processes be so alien to ours that nothing of awe or wonder will be able to touch them? But despite the discovery &#x2013; in 1997 was it? &#x2013; of a planet which the astronomers told us could support life, few of us really believe that they will come. They must be there. It is surely unreasonable to credit that only one small star in the immensity of the universe is capable of developing and supporting intelligent life. But we shall not get to them and they will not come to us.<br><br>Twenty years ago, when the world was already half convinced that our species had lost for ever the power to reproduce, the search to find the last-known human birth became a universal obsession, elevated to a matter of national pride, an international contest as ultimately pointless as it was fierce and acrimonious. To qualify the birth had to be officially notified, the date and precise time recorded. This effectively excluded a high proportion of the human race where the day but not the hour was known, and it was accepted, but not emphasized, that the result could never be conclusive. Almost certainly in some remote jungle, in some primitive hut, the last human being had slipped largely unnoticed into an unregarding world. But after months of checking and re-checking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at two minutes past three Western time on 19 October 1995, had been officially recognized. Once the result was proclaimed, he was left to exploit his celebrity as best he could while the world, as if suddenly aware of the futility of the exercise, turned its attention elsewhere. And now he is dead and I doubt whether any country will be eager to drag the other candidates from oblivion.<br><br>We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause. Western science and Western medicine haven&#x2019;t prepared us for the magnitude and humiliation of this ultimate failure. There have been many diseases which have been difficult to diagnose or cure and one which almost depopulated two continents before it spent itself. But we have always in the end been able to explain why. We have given names to the viruses and germs which, even today, take possession of us, much to our chagrin since it seems a personal affront that they should still assail us, like old enemies who keep up the skirmish and bring down the occasional victim when their victory is assured. Western science has been our god. In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods, but in the knowledge that despite our apostasy, this deity, our creature and our slave, would still provide for us; the anaesthetic for the pain, the spare heart, the new lung, the antibiotic, the moving wheels and the moving pictures. The light will always come on when we press the switch and if it doesn&#x2019;t we can find out why. Science was never a subject I was at home with. I understood little of it at school and I understand little more now that I&#x2019;m fifty. Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died. I can clearly remember the confident words of one biologist spoken when it had finally become apparent that nowhere in the whole world was there a pregnant woman: &#x201c;It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.&#x201d; We have had twenty-five years and we no longer even expect to succeed. Like a lecherous stud suddenly stricken with impotence, we are humiliated at the very heart of our faith in ourselves. For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought. No wonder we both worship and resent them.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Gems of Costume Jewelry</h2><p>Large book with Brodart jacket cover. 260 pages of rhinestone costume jewelry with many color photos.

Seizing territory in Canada and representation in Britain; expelling the French, and even their British forefathers, American leaders George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson paved their nation&#x2019;s way to independence. With the first buds of public relation techniques of communication, dramatization, and propaganda America flourished into a vision of freedom, of enterprise, and of unalienable human rights.<br><br>In <i>Flight of the Eagle</i>, Conrad Black provides a perspective on American history that is unprecedented. Through his analysis of the strategic development of the United States from 1754-1992, Black describes nine phases&#x201d; of the strategic rise of the nation, in which it progressed through grave challenges, civil and foreign wars, and secured a place for itself under the title of Superpower.&#x201d; Black discredits prevailing notions that our unrivaled status is the product of good geography, demographics, and good luck. Instead, he reveals and analyzes the specific strategic decisions of great statesmen through the ages that transformed the world as we know it and established America&#x2019;s place in it.<br></p><p>Conrad Black wrote acclaimed biographies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. He was the chairman of the &#34;Telegraph&#34; newspapers in Britain, 1987-2003, and founded the &#34;National Post&#34; in Canada, where he remains a columnist.

Between 1927 and 1947, West and her cousin, the poet Helene Johnson, lived in New York City where West attended Columbia University, worked as a welfare investigator, wrote for the WPA, traveled to Russia, and established a literary magazine for young black writers. <br><br>During these years, West and Johnson knew virtually everyone in New York's artistic, intellectual, and political circles. Their friends included Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Carl Van Vechten, Richard Wright, Arna Bontemps, Claude McKay, and many others. West moved easily between the bohemian milieu of her artistic soul mates and the bourgeois, respectable soirees of prominent social and political figures.<br><br>In this book, Professors Mitchell and Davis provide a carefully researched profile of West and her circle that serves as an introduction to a well-edited, representative collection of her out-of-print, little-known, or unpublished writings, supplemented by many family photographs. The editors document West's "womanist" upbringing and her relationships with her mother, Rachel Benson West, and other strong-minded women, including her longtime companion Marian Minus. <br><br>The volume includes examples of West's probing social criticism in the form of WPA essays and stories, as well as her interviews with Southern migrants. A centerpiece of the book is her unpublished novella, <i>Where the Wild Grape Grows</i>, which explores with grace and gentle irony the complex relationship of three retired women living on Martha's Vineyard. Several of West's exquisitely observed nature pieces, published over a span of twenty years in the <i>Vineyard Gazette</i>, are also reprinted.</p><p>"This collection of West's work will certainly help readers see that she did not simply 'fall silent' in the 1940s only to return to writing to complete 'The Wedding' in the 1980s. This book enables us to see her as a more thoroughly accomplished writer. It is an important work that will lead to a serious revision of West's place in the canon of African American writers."--Joseph T. Skerrett, author of "Literature, Race, and Ethnicity: Contesting American Identities" <p>"What a great idea to gather in one volume the many previously published and unpublished writings of Dorothy West! . . . This edition throws special light on West's talent and milieu, conveying a complex sense of her as a person in relationship to her family life and commitments, her artistic peers, and her intimate relationships. The editors' introduction and the biographical essay set the right tone for the project, appropriate for both the academic and the general reader."--Amritjit Singh, coeditor of "The Collected Writings of Wallace Thurman: A Harlem Renaissance Reader"</p>DOROTHY WEST was born in Boston in 1907 and died on Martha&#39;s Vineyard in 1998.

Business historian Alfred D. Chandler Jr. thoroughly documents the rise and fall of big players in the consumer electronic and computer industries in <i>Inventing the Electronic Century</i>.<p>It's not light reading--Chandler draws on mountainous reserves of knowledge of business, politics, technology, and social trends to reach his conclusions, and the narrative relies equally on boardroom stories and commercial data. Still, the book's compelling, often cautionary tales should help managers and investors see patterns underlying their own industrial behaviors, and perhaps emulate Sony more than RCA.</p><p>The scope of the book can be daunting, and in many ways parallels the global changes seen throughout the century, including the rise of the Japanese economy, the capricious American commercial sector, and the relative stasis of postwar Europe. Committed and patient readers will gain insight into the nature of the tech industry in <i>Inventing the Electronic Century</i>, and then start inventing the next one. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Alfred D.

Martin Luther King, Jr., including the famed "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington. The quality of some is poor, but the words are still understandable. And the tinny nature of some only adds to the realism. It makes listeners feel like they are sitting in the back of a Baptist church hearing history being made. Each speech is introduced by an essay by another prominent civil rights activist. Some, such as the one by the Dalai Lama, are personal reminiscences, as well as inspirational charges in their own right. Others are meant to set the scene for King's speech and discuss its impact.

But the New Orleans underworld consisted of much more than the local bordellos. It was also well known as the early gambling capital of the United States, and sported one of the most violent records of street crime in the country. In The French Quarter, Herbert Asbury, author of The Gangs of New York, chronicles this rather immense underbelly of "The Big Easy." From the murderous exploits of Mary Jane "Bricktop" Jackson and Bridget Fury, two prostitutes who became famous after murdering a number of their associates, to the faux-revolutionary "filibusters" who, backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of public support&#x2014;though without official governmental approval&#x2014;undertook military missions to take over the bordering Spanish regions in Texas, the French Quarter had it all.

For the birds did come, descending on London by the thousands or even millions, inexplicably and seemingly out of nowhere. At first, the birds did little but congregate and watch, and Londoners found them amusing, if perhaps a bit odd. But then they began to show their sinister side: attacking, maiming, and even killing in incidents of tremendous brutality and violence. Were they a force of nature, or a supernatural manifestation? No one knew. The only thing that was clear was that the birds' aim was the destruction of mankind, and no one had any idea how to stop them. . . . <br><br> <i>The Birds</i> (1936) went largely unnoticed when originally published, but after the release of Alfred Hitchcock's popular film in 1963, Frank Baker (1908-1983) threatened to sue, believing the film had borrowed from his book. <i>The Birds</i> was last reprinted in 1964, in a "revised" edition that in fact failed to incorporate hundreds of additions, deletions, and corrections Baker had made.

Pete Van Wieren&#x2019;s legacy began in 1976, when he and a young Skip Caray were hired to call Atlanta Braves games. During the next three decades, "the Professor" and Caray became the voices of a team known nationwide as America's Team courtesy of Ted Turner's SuperStation TBS. In this heartfelt autobiography, Van Wieren shares his memories of thrilling moments in Braves history, such as the 1995 season when the Braves won the world championship; the pitching mastery of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz; the heartbreak of the 1996 World Series loss to the Yankees; and Atlanta's unprecedented run of 14 consecutive division titles.</p><p>As a boy growing up in upstate New York, Pete Van Wieren dreamed of becoming the play-by-play voice of his hometown heroes, the Triple A Rochester Red Wings. Instead, he found big-league broadcast heaven in Atlanta. In 1976, Van Wieren and another young broadcaster named Skip Caray, son of the legendary Harry Caray, were hired to call Atlanta Braves games. Over the next three decades, they were the voices of America&#39;s Team, as the Braves became known thanks to Ted Turner&#39;s TBS superstation. For 33 seasons, Van Wieren - nicknamed &#34;the Professor&#34; for his scholarly approach to baseball and resemblance to a college professor - saw it all and called it all, including mercurial owner Ted Turner&#39;s one-game stint as the Braves&#39; manager in 1976. And then, in the midst of 15 seasons of mostly awful and often hilariously inept baseball, came the Miracle of 1991, when the Braves went from worst to first, captured Atlanta&#39;s heart, and nearly won one of the greatest World Series ever played<b>Pete Van Wieren</b> is the former play-by-play voice of the Atlanta Braves.

Contributors from history, literature, film, art history, and anthropology describe a culture of fascism in Japan in the decades preceding the end of the Asia-Pacific War. In so doing, they challenge past scholarship, which has generally rejected descriptions of pre-1945 Japan as fascist. The contributors explain how a fascist ideology was diffused throughout Japanese culture via literature, popular culture, film, design, and everyday discourse. Alan Tansman&#x2019;s introduction places the essays in historical context and situates them in relation to previous scholarly inquiries into the existence of fascism in Japan.<p></p><p>Several contributors examine how fascism was understood in the 1930s by, for example, influential theorists, an antifascist literary group, and leading intellectuals responding to capitalist modernization. Others explore the idea that fascism&#x2019;s solution to alienation and exploitation lay in efforts to beautify work, the workplace, and everyday life. Still others analyze the realization of and limits to fascist aesthetics in film, memorial design, architecture, animal imagery, a military museum, and a national exposition. Contributors also assess both manifestations of and resistance to fascist ideology in the work of renowned authors including the Nobel-prize-winning novelist and short-story writer Kawabata Yasunari and the mystery writers Edogawa Ranpo and Hamao Shir&#x14d;. In the work of these final two, the tropes of sexual perversity and paranoia open a new perspective on fascist culture. This volume makes Japanese fascism available as a critical point of comparison for scholars of fascism worldwide. The concluding essay models such work by comparing Spanish and Japanese fascisms.</p><p><i>Contributors</i>. Noriko Aso, Michael Baskett, Kim Brandt, Nina Cornyetz, Kevin M.

Starting right now.<br><br>He climbed down, stiff and sore from the long drive, waging war with himself for calm, even for courage. His new house, like his new life, was an old one, but he'd make it right, make everything right from cellar to roof, inside and out. He was taking his life's biggest step forward by taking many steps back.<br><br>He unlatched the back doors of the truck and yanked them open. From the dark cavern loaded with his meager possessions, piles of wood, and handmade furniture, he dragged out his toolbox and flopped it open on the grass. He strapped on his leather tool belt, jammed wire cutters, screwdriver, metal snips, a claw hammer, and needle-nose pliers in the pockets. Pulling on leather work gloves, he grabbed a saw.<br><br>He scraped his tall stepladder out, hefted it next to the back porch, and jerked it open. With his flashlight wedged in his belt, he climbed to the porch roof, then to the steeper shingled roof of the house. He hunkered down next to the tall television antenna and began to work.<br><br>In five minutes he had cut the antenna loose. He shoved it over the side. It crashed two stories down, shuddered, and lay still.<br><br>Next, he dug at the nails and metal bands securing the two old lightning rods, but did not toss them over. They would fetch a good price as antiques at the Saturday morning auction in Pleasant.<br><br>He gazed at the plain, clean roofline with relief, for it would publicly declare his commitment to all who rode by. Sweating in the cool breeze, Daniel thrust aloft the rods like trophies of his victory. He had conquered himself; he had come home.<br><br>Slowly, he lowered the rods to his knees and gazed down from his precarious perch. The dark bulk of the U-Haul waiting to be unloaded was his last link to his previous life. He had snapped the radio off once he crossed the state line from Indiana, right in the middle of that bouncy-beat chorus he loved in "Achy Breaky Heart." He didn't mind giving up country music for good, he tried to convince himself. After he turned the truck in tomorrow, he'd never drive again, either.<br><br>The only lights he could see were from Verna Sprigg's Sewing Circle Shop and its second-story living quarters across the field. Two large farms, his own family's and his sister Emma's in-laws', lay beyond his lot line, but kerosene lanterns could never be spotted from here. No traffic on the road, nothing but star speckles overhead until he watched the full moon, big as a ripe peach, roll over the hilly horizon. It was a stunning sight, but he had things to do.<br><br>The knot in his stomach yanked tight again as he scooted crab-like from the roof, to the porch, and descended the ladder. He laid the lightning rods in the grass. Under the clay pot where Emma said it would be, he found the key. He unlocked the creaky back door and went in. The interior smelled of vinegar, lemon, and soap; Emma had written that she and her girls would have it spick-and-span for him.<br><br>He turned on no lights and never would here&#x2014;not the electric, anyway. Tomorrow he would disconnect it and have the wires pulled soon, the ones for the telephone, too, for he hoped to bring a good, Plain woman here, one he could trust and, hopefully, someday love.<br><br>In the empty living room, the thick soles of his work boots sank into what Emma had described as fairly new wall-to-wall carpet, thick and green as grass, you won't believe it, Dan. He flicked off the f lashlight and stood silent. But even in the dark, he saw pairs of white, fancy, ruff led draperies at each window like graceful ghosts bowing to a partner for a dance. He yanked them all down and hurled them in a corner.<br><br>Tears burned Brooke Benton's eyes as she listened to her niece Jennifer's closing to her bedtime prayer to "please tell my mommy I still love her. Especially because it's Mother's Day. And good night, God. Amen."<br><br>Brooke bent down to kiss the child's forehead. "You know," Brooke said, "God has a very good memory, so maybe you don't need to remind Him of that every night, because then both of us just start crying."<br><br>"Yes, but <em>she </em>used to forget things sometimes. When she was sick, I had to tell her some stuff again and again. So I'm asking Him to remind <em>her,</em>" Jennifer insisted in her seven-year-old's logic that often amazed Brooke.<br><br>"Come on now. It's hit the hay time, as Mrs. Spriggs says," Brooke urged, plumping up her pillow and trying to make her voice light. "That Monday-morning school bus will be here bright and early, Jen."<br><br>"I guess Daddy would be mad at me for going to bed late, don't you think?"<br><br>Brooke sank back on the edge of the four-poster bed and gently stroked Jennifer's hair. "No, I'm sure he'd understand that we were just having fun. I told you he's not mad at you for anything."<br><br>Frowning, the petite, blue-eyed blonde looked away to arrange her two dolls, leaned against the other pillow. They were totally mismatched: the small, molded plastic, adolescent Skipper doll had been Jennifer's mother Melanie's years ago; the soft, faceless Amish baby doll, named Nettie, was a recent gift from her friend Susie.<br><br>"I know," Jennifer said, her voice shaky with exhaustion and emotion, "that Daddy's not mad at me because Mommy died. That wasn't anyone's fault but cancer."<br><br>"That's right" was all Brooke could manage, but even then her voice broke. She still stroked Jennifer's hair; the child sighed and turned onto her side to cuddle into her deep down pillow. After tucking the sheet and quilt around Jennifer's thin shoulders, Brooke rubbed her niece's back, went out, and snapped off the light. A floorboard creaked loudly, but it would take a bomb to wake Jennifer once she fell asleep in this pretty haven of her room.<br><br>The bed, pillow, quilt, the rag rugs on the floor&#x2014;Brooke thought again how this old but vibrant house and store below were just like their owner, Verna Spriggs. Brooke missed her, but it had been her suggestion that Verna seize the chance for a long visit to her son's family in Maine. And immersing herself in Verna's duties made her feel useful as well as safe and sane again.<br><br>Brooke went downstairs to the big quilting room where she and Jennifer had been practicing line dancing with a videotape called <em>Country Dance Time. </em>Learning the Elvira and the Tush Push to the lilting, rhythmic tunes was one of many shared activities that bound them closer. Tonight Jennifer had gotten so into it, she seemed to temporarily forget her troubles, too.<br><br>Brooke pulled the quilted cover off the TV again&#x2014;for when it was not in use, they kept it draped in deference to the Amish who came here&#x2014;and rewound the tape to lesson one, the grapevine step. With the sound turned low, in her jeans, T-shirt, and beat-up boots, she did the grapevine around the room&#x2014;step, behind, step, kick&#x2014;while she straightened the quilts for sale on their circular revolving racks, retacked price cards for pieced wall hangings and table runners on the peg-board display, and aligned booklets and supply boxes on shelves. Monday morning would come too soon for her, too.<br><br>The two group quilts in progress&#x2014;a Courthouse Steps and a Drunkard's Path&#x2014;stretched on their separate rectangular frames needed no tending, for the Amish women who stitched them always left things immaculately ordered. Her only real Amish friend so far, Emma Kurtz, who oversaw things, made certain of that.<br><br>But Brooke noticed some scraps under one quilt where Emma's youngest, Susie, and Jennifer had been playing house on Saturday. She crawled under to pick those up. The vacuum didn't reach clear under here, anyway.<br><br>She jumped when she heard a knock&#x2014;and on the back door at this hour. Her heart thudding, she scrambled out from under the quilt, then calmed herself as she snapped on the kitchen light and walked to the back door. This was not the city, she scolded herself, and he&#x2014;or them&#x2014;couldn't possibly find her here. It was probably just an Amish person wanting to use the phone.<br><br>She peered out through the window and smiled in relief. Emma's eldest child, Katie, age eighteen, who came with her to quilt if she was not tending the house or her siblings, stood there with three others. Holding Katie's hand until the door opened was Gideon Stoltz, Maplecreek's blacksmith's son, whom Brooke knew Katie had been dating. Behind them stood two other young people about Katie's age whom Brooke did not know.<br><br>"Your lights, we saw them still on," Katie said. "Stop by with Gid anytime for an ice-cream bar, you said&#x2014;that Ha&#x2014;Hagens..."<br><br>"H�agen-Dazs. Yes, please, all of you, come in."<br><br>"This is Cora Troyer, my best run-around friend, and this is her come-calling friend, Ezra Yoder," Katie told her, blushing ever so slightly under the freckles speckling her cheeks and pert nose.<br><br>The girls removed their black shawls and bonnets, leaving their white starched <em>kapps </em>covering the back of their heads. All Amish women wore their uncut tresses parted in the center and swept straight back in a hidden knot. Katie's green eyes looked huge behind her wire-framed glasses, especially because her dress was emerald green. How much she looked like Emma, even the glasses, Brooke thought, warmed by the fact these four had come to visit. It showed her acceptance in the community was growing, even without Verna, whom the Maplecreek Amish had known and trusted for years.<br><br>The boys did not remove their straw hats, nor do more than nod. No <em>pleased to meet you'</em>s, and Brooke knew to expect no <em>thank you'</em>s or even a <em>good-bye. </em>For such polite pleasantries were deemed "fancy" or "prideful" by the Plain People, who tried as best they could to live separate from what they called worldly folk. At least, that evidently did not mean avoiding an outsider named Brooke Benton or the rich ice-cream bars that were her worst edible indulgence.<br><br>"Now, each of you choose what one you'd like," she prompted after she had trooped them down past shelves of fabric bolts into the back basement storage room and lifted the heavy lid of Verna's old chest freezer. Most of it was filled with food stored here for Katie's family, who bartered home-baked bread and canned goods for its use. Brooke had taken to keeping her storehouse of chocolate ecstasy down here so she wasn't tempted every time she got an ice cube from the kitchen.<br><br>When the four of them just stared down into the swirl of frosted air, Brooke prompted, "Let's see, we have Heath Toffee or Snickers Ice-Cream Bars, you know, like frozen candy bars. Maybe you should all try a different one and compare."<br><br>She should have known they'd all take the same kind so as not to look special or individual. They selected H�agen-Dazs as, she surmised, the ersatz name sounded German to them. Upstairs, she gave them napkins and pulled five chairs from around the quilting frames into a circle.<br><br>"Any day now my Uncle Daniel will come home and be your neighbor," Katie offered in the silence as paper wrappers ripped and crinkled open. "Clear from Goshen, Indiana."<br><br>"Your mother told me he bought the old Whitman place across the field," Brooke responded. "I hear they had modernized it."<br><br>"Mm," Gideon said with his mouth full. "If he's really back to join the church, he'll have to convert it back. The black sheep comes home. Daniel Brand could tell us how to have a good, long <em>rumspringa, </em>I bet, yeah."<br><br>Cora said with her mouth half full, "The running-around time our young people have to try different things in life&#x2014;even in the world&#x2014;that's <em>rumspringa. </em>To see if we really want to commit to being Amish."<br><br>"The whole church will be glad to have Uncle Daniel home," Katie picked up her original topic. "My grandfather Jacob, especially."<br><br>"I'm sure it is hard for the bishop to have his own son living away from the family and church," Brooke said.<br><br>"In church this morning, Grandfather talked about it. But just now, heading home from a hymn sing, that's where we were," Katie explained, licking her chocolate instead of biting into it. "By midnight I'm supposed to be in the house&#x2014;what you English call a curfew, Miss Brooke."<br><br>Gideon scooted his chair slightly closer to Katie's as she spoke. "His own buggy, Ezra has one, too, for courting, but it broke an axle, so tonight we came together."<br><br>"I'm so glad you did. I know how much Katie likes ice cream, and I told her she hadn't lived until she'd had a H�agen-Dazs."<br><br>They nodded, and Brooke realized how silly it must sound to hear someone English, as the Amish called non-Amish, claim an ice-cream bar made any sort of difference in one's life. In just a few years these four would probably be committed to their church, married, and rearing families. And here, at age thirty-one, she had done none of those big, life-shaping things.<br><br>"A lot of fun gadding about," Ezra said, "like telling riddles. Know how to double your money real easy, Miss Brooke?"<br><br>"No, but I wish I did," Brooke replied, willing to play straight man to these very straight kids. Their wholesome na�vet� always struck some strange chord in her.<br><br>"To double your money real easy, just fold it in half," Ezra said, then had to dive for his ice cream to keep from losing a huge chunk of chocolate. As they all laughed, Brooke noticed that Ezra sported a forbidden wristwatch and all four of them wore Reebok running shoes.<br><br>"The English&#x2014;well, I don't mean you and Mrs. Verna&#x2014;got the wrong idea about Plain People," Katie declared when she saw Brooke looking at their feet. "Like we're sticks-in-the-mud or something. Our own fun, we have plenty of that, and we've been around a worldly place or two, uh-huh."<br><br>"I'll bet you have," Brooke managed, fighting to keep a smile from her lips.<br><br>"Promise you won't tell my mother?" Katie asked, leaning forward in her chair. Brooke didn't want to know something taboo she couldn't tell Emma. But what could this bunch possibly have done bad?<br><br>"I won't tell," she vowed.<br><br>"That dinosaur movie, we saw it in Pleasant," Katie whispered.<br><br>"<em>Jurassic Park? </em>I wouldn't let Jennifer see that."<br><br>"Real scary," Katie said, almost gloating while the others smiled. "People screamed right out and everything. We dressed English, we saw it, and <em>fressed, </em>too."<br><br></p><h2>Problems of Knowledge and Freedom: The Russell Lectures</h2><p><p>Originally delivered in 1971 as the first Cambridge lectures in memory of Bertrand Russell, <i>Problems of Knowledge and Freedom</i> is a masterful and cogent synthesis of Noam Chomsky&#x2019;s moral philosophy, linguistic analysis, and emergent political critique of America&#x2019;s war in Vietnam.</p> <p>In the first half of this wide-ranging work, Chomsky takes up Russell&#x2019;s lifelong search for the empirical principles of human understanding, in a philosophical overview referencing Hume, Wittgenstein, von Humboldt, and others.

They found each other, adrift but determined, on the streets of New York City in the late '60s and made a pact to keep each other afloat until they found their voices--or the world was ready to hear them. Lovers first and then friends as Mapplethorpe discovered he was gay, they divided their dimes between art supplies and Coney Island hot dogs. Mapplethorpe was quicker to find his metier, with a Polaroid and then a Hasselblad, but Smith was the first to fame, transformed, to her friend's delight, from a poet into a rock star. (Mapplethorpe soon became famous too--and notorious--before his death from AIDS in 1989.) Smith's memoir of their friendship, <i>Just Kids</i>, is tender and artful, open-eyed but surprisingly decorous, with the oracular style familiar from her anthems like "Because the Night," "Gloria," and "Dancing Barefoot" balanced by her powers of observation and memory for everyday details like the price of automat sandwiches and the shabby, welcoming fellow bohemians of the Chelsea Hotel, among whose ranks these baby Rimbauds found their way. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><p><em>Just Kids</em> begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions. A true fable, it is a portrait of two young artists&#x2019; ascent, a prelude to fame.</p></p><h2>Power Girl: Power Trip</h2><p>The fan-favorite writing team of Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray (JONAH HEX, TERRA) team with popular aritst Amanda Conner (JSA CLASSIFIED, TERRA) for the rip-roaring solo adventures of Power Girl.

Lured by a seemingly invincible gang culture, he witnessed countless shootings, beatings, and arrests, then watched with increasing fear as drugs, murder, suicide, and senseless acts of street crime claimed friends and family members. Before long Rodriguez saw a way out of the barrio through education and the power of words, and successfully broke free from years of violence and desperation. Achieving success as an award-winning Chicano poet, he was sure the streets would haunt him no more -- until his young son joined a gang. Rodriguez fought for his child by telling his own story in <i>Always Running,</i> a vivid memoir that explores the motivations of gang life and cautions against the death and destruction that inevitably claim its participants. At times heartbreakingly sad and brutal, <i>Always Running</i> is ultimately an uplifting true story, filled with hope, insight, and a hard-earned lesson for the next generation.</p></p><p>The son of Mexican immigrants, <i>Luis J. Rodriguez</i> grew up in Watts and East Los Angeles. He began writing in his early teens, and eventually won national recognition as a poet, journalist, and critic. He is currently working as a peacemaker among inner-city gangs and runs Tia Chucha Press, which publishes emerging, socially conscious poets. He lives in Chicago.<p> <b>CHAPTER ONE</b> </p><p> "Cry, child, for those without tears have a grief which never ends."<br> Mexican saying </p><p> This memory begins with flight. A 1950s bondo-spackled Dodge surged through a driving rain, veering around the potholes and upturned tracks of the abandoned Red Line trains on Alameda. Mama was in the front seat. My father was at the wheel. My brother <i>Rano</i> and I sat on one end of the back seat; my sisters <i>Pata</i> and <i>Cuca</i> on the other. There was a space between the boys and girls to keep us apart. </p><p> <i>"Am�, mira a Rano,"</i> a voice said for the tenth time from the back of the car. "He's hitting me again." </p><p> We fought all the time. My brother, especially, had it in for <i>La Pata</i> -- thinking of Frankenstein, he called her "Anastein." Her real name was Aha, but most of the time we went by the animal names Dad gave us at birth. I am <i>Grillo,</i> which means cricket. <i>Rano</i> stands for "rana," the frog. <i>La Pata</i> is the duck and <i>Cuca</i> is short for <i>cucaracha:</i> cockroach. </p><p> The car seats came apart in strands. I looked out at the passing cars which seemed like ghosts with headlights rushing past the streaks of water on the glass. I was nine years old. As the rain fell, my mother cursed in Spanish intermixed with pleas to saints and <i>"la Sant�sima Madre de Dios."</i> She argued with my father. Dad didn't curse or raise his voice. He just stated the way things were. </p><p> "I'll never go back to Mexico," he said. "I'd rather starve here. You want to stay with me, it has to be in Los Angeles. Otherwise, go." We were on the way to the Union train station in downtown L.A. We had our few belongings stuffed into the trunk and underneath our feet. I gently held on to one of the comic books Mama bought to keep us entertained. I had on my Sunday best clothes with chewed gum stuck in a coat pocket. It could have been Easter, but it was a weeping November. I don't remember for sure why we were leaving. I just knew it was a special day. There was no fear or concern on my part. We were always moving. I looked at the newness of the comic book and felt some exhilaration of its feel in my hand. Mama had never bought us comic books before. It had to be a special day. </p><p> For months we had been pushed from one house to another, just Mama and us children. Mom and Dad had split up prior to this. We stayed at the homes of women my mom called <i>comadres,</i> with streams of children of their own. Some nights we slept in a car or in the living rooms of people we didn't know. There were no shelters for homeless families. My mother tried to get us settled somewhere but all indications pointed to our going back to the land of her birth, to her red earth, her Mexico. </p><p> The family consisted of my father Alfonso, my mom Mar�a Estela, my older brother, Jos� Ren�, and my younger sisters, Ana Virginia and Gloria Estela. I recall my father with his wavy hair and clean-shaven face, his correct, upright and stubborn demeanor, in contrast to my mother who was heavy-set with Native features and thick straight hair, often laughing heartily, her eyes narrowed to slits, and sometimes crying from a deep tomb-like place with a sound like swallowing mud. </p><p> As we got closer to the Union station, Los Angeles loomed low and large, a city of odd construction, a good place to get lost in. I, however, would learn to hide in imaginative worlds -- in books; in TV shows, where I picked up much of my English; in solitary play with mangled army men and crumpled toy trucks. I was so withdrawn it must have looked scary. </p><p> This is what I know: When I was two years old, our family left Ciudad Ju�rez, Chihuahua, for Los Angeles. My father was an educated man, unusual for our border town, a hunger city filled to the hills with cardboard hovels of former peasants, Indians and dusk-faced children. In those days, an educated man had to be careful about certain things -- questioning authority, for example. Although the principal of a local high school, my father failed to succumb to the local chieftains who were linked to the national party which ruled Mexico, as one famous Latin American writer would later say, with a "perfect dictatorship." </p><p> When Dad first became principal, there were no funds due to the massive bureaucratic maze he had to get through to get them. The woman he lived with then was an artist who helped raise money for the school by staging exhibitions. My father used his own money to pay for supplies and at one point had the iron fence around the school tom down and sold for scrap. </p><p> One year, Dad received an offer for a six-month study program for foreign teachers in Bloomington, Indiana. He liked it so much, he renewed it three times. By then, my father had married his secretary, my mother, after the artist left him. They had their first child, Jos� Ren�. </p><p> By the time my father returned, his enemies had mapped out a means to remove him -- being a high school principal is a powerful position in a place like Ciudad Juarez. My father faced a pile of criminal charges, including the alleged stealing of school funds. Police arrived at the small room in the <i>vecindad</i> where Mama and Dad lived and escorted him to the city jail. </p><p> For months my father fought the charges. While he was locked up, they fed him scraps of food in a rusted steel can. They denied him visitors -- Mama had to climb a section of prison wall and pick up 2-year-old Jos� Ren� so he could see his father. Finally, after a lengthy trial, my father was found innocent -- but he no longer had his position as principal. </p><p> Dad became determined to escape to the United States. My mother, on the other hand, never wanted to leave Mexico; she did it to be with Dad. </p><p> Mama was one of two daughters in a family run by a heavy-drinking, wife-beating railroad worker and musician. My mother was the only one in her family to complete high school. Her brothers, Kiko and Rodolfo, often crossed the border to find work and came back with stories of love and brawls on the other side. </p><p> Their grandmother was a Tarahumara Indian who once walked down from the mountainous area in the state of Chihuahua where her people lived in seclusion for centuries. The Spanish never conquered them. But their grandmother never returned to her people. She eventually gave birth to my grandmother, Aha Acosta. </p><p> Ana's first husband was a railroad worker during the Mexican Revolution; he lost his life when a tunnel exploded during a raid. They brought his remains in a box. Aha was left alone with one son, while pregnant with a daughter. Lucita, the daughter, eventually died of convulsions at the age of four, and Manolo, the son, was later blinded after a bout with a deadly form of chicken pox which struck and killed many children in the area. </p><p> Later Aha married my grandfather, M�nico Jim�nez, who like her first husband worked the railroads. At one point, M�nico quit the rails to play trumpet and sing for bands in various night clubs. Once he ended up in Los Angeles, but with another woman. In fact, M�nico had many other women. My grandmother often had to cross over to the railroad yards, crowded with prostitutes and where M�nico spent many nights singing, to bring him home. </p><p> When my parents married, Mama was 27; Dad almost 40. She had never known any other man. He already had four or five children from three or four other women. She was an emotionally-charged, border woman, full of fire, full of pain, full of giving love. He was a stoic, unfeeling, unmoved intellectual who did as he pleased as much as she did all she could to please him. This dichotomous couple, this sun and moon, this <i>curandera</i> and biologist, dreamer and realist, fire woman and water man, molded me; these two sides created a life-long conf</p></p><h2>Hounded: The Iron Druid Chronicles (Iron Druid Chronicles, 1)</h2><p><p><b>The first novel in the Iron Druid Chronicles&#x2014;introducing a cool, new, funny urban fantasy hero</b></p><p>Atticus O&#x2019;Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound.

All thought of that long-ago Hong Kong night vanished during the daylight hours only to reappear when sleep claimed the eighty-four-year-old woman. As the small rubber boat bobbed up and down in the cold waters outside Hong Kong harbor she remembered the feel of the piece of stone block and the touch of Garrison Lee&#x2019;s fingers as the dream continued. In her sleep the woman wanted to cry out that she didn&#x2019;t want the relic, she wanted him. As always in her dream all Lee would do is smile and wink that irritating wink he always did to make her think everything was all right&#x2014;she knew it wasn&#x2019;t. This was the same dream Alice had been having for the past six days and it always ended the same way&#x2014;with the feeling of massive loss and the sharp pain of her heart breaking every time she saw Garrison in the dream. <br>&#x201c;Hamilton, you&#x2019;re obviously dreaming this for a reason&#x2014; <i>now wake up!&#x201d;</i> <br>The voice of a man gone for a full year woke her as she lay at her small desk in her bedroom. She had fallen asleep again at her computer terminal and as she looked at the screen she saw the jumbled words in one long and continuous sentence, the result of her head lying on the keyboard. <br>Alice Hamilton reached out and angrily punched at the keyboard and cleared the screen of all the nonsensical words. As she yawned she looked at the clock on the wall. It was four-thirty in the morning and for the fifth straight night she had fallen asleep while in the midst of her research, and that in turn brought on the dreams of Garrison Lee and the time they spent together in China in the forties. Alice straightened in her chair, finally remembering what had prompted this dream in particular. She frantically searched the scattered papers on her usually neat desk. <br>&#x201c;Where is it, where is it!&#x201d; she asked herself, almost fearing the letter itself was part of her sleeping remembrances. <br> <i>&#x201c;Calm down and think,&#x201d;</i> came his voice. This was a tool she used many times. Garrison always told her think and then act. <br>Alice stopped her searching and then squeezed her eyes closed and thought. She opened them suddenly and reached for her robe&#x2019;s front pocket. She took a deep breath as her fingers touched the two-page letter that had been overnighted from Rome. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said as she pulled the letter from her pocket and opened it, sitting back in her chair as she did. Alice again closed her eyes realizing that she just thanked a man gone from her for what seemed an eternity. She swallowed and then caught herself and mentally shook the tears from her eyes before they fully developed and then opened the letter. She read it once more for the umpteenth time in the twenty-four hours since receiving it. <br>&#x201c;Europa, am I still signed in?&#x201d; she said aloud as she folded the letter but this time held it tightly in her hand as she forced herself to relax. Alice was finally feeling her age after many years of keeping up with the best of them. <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Hamilton, User 0012 is still logged on,&#x201d; came the sexy Marilyn Monroe&#x2013;voiced Cray supercomputer located at the secure center inside the Event Group complex underneath Nellis Air Force Base ten miles from her house. <br>&#x201c;My apologies for being rude and dozing off on you,&#x201d; Alice said as she pulled her robe tighter around her. <br>&#x201c;Computer center activity is light, access should be uninterrupted until 0600.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, thank you anyway, Europa. Now, can you&#x2026;&#x201d; Alice stopped briefly to stifle a yawn, making herself realize she was getting far too old for these all-night research digs. &#x201c;Excuse me, can you give me the status of security element Goliath please?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Security element Goliath has not reported in as of this time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Europa, I am expecting a package through the complex communications system and I want that e-mail package to come straight to me and is not, I repeat, is not to be entered into the incoming communications log. Is that clear?&#x201d; <br>For the first time in many years Europa didn&#x2019;t answer right away. Alice thought maybe her systems were still being disrupted from the troubles a few months earlier when her mainframe was attacked from an outside source. <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Hamilton, your request cannot be granted due to security regulations.&#x201d; <br>Alice closed her eyes knowing that she could seal the incoming e-mail off from everyone&#x2014;except one man, and that was the head of Event Group security and the smartest man outside of Garrison Lee and Director Niles Compton that she had ever known&#x2014;Colonel Jack Collins. As far as she could see there was no way around Jack not seeing the e-mail, especially from a source as important to Department 5656 as anyone could ever remember&#x2014;Goliath, a code name for one of the security departments and Director Compton&#x2019;s most guarded deep operatives. The information this agent gives the Group is as important as any historical intelligence they had ever received from any one source. Goliath was deep&#x2014;the deepest any security element had ever been before, and only Jack, Niles, deputy director Virginia Pollock, Captain Carl Everett, and Alice knew who it was and where he, or she, was buried. <br>&#x201c;I understand, Europa, but no one else gets copied on the package. I hope I can handle Colonel Collins on this one security oversight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Incoming packet has arrived, Mrs. Hamilton.&#x201d; <br>Alice was stunned at how fast her requested data from their deep operative came as a follow-up to the first communication, which had set Alice on a course of action she had wanted to take since 1951. <br>&#x201c;Put it through, please,&#x201d; she said. <br>The coded pictures sent by Goliath slowly started coming up on her monitor as fast as Europa could decipher them. As she scanned the screen trying to figure out what the coded pixels were starting to form, her eyes started to widen and then recognition struck and with her usual self-control lost for the moment, Alice clapped her hands together and let out a yelp. She stood and hopped once as she picked up a picture of Garrison Lee that sat upon her desk. She kissed it, knowing in real life that gesture would have caused an immediate rebuke if it had not been done in private. She looked at the pictures once more as Europa broke them down into a four-square shot and they all clearly showed the item she had for so long searched. <br>&#x201c;You were right, damn you, you were right! This would have been something that had to have been covered up. And it was your idea to get someone inside&#x2014;oh, not for this, you old goat, but I figured our agent was in place anyway so why not have him do a little private searching for me?&#x201d; She kissed the picture again. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;ve got to kiss Jack and Niles for getting our agent placed!&#x201d; Alice stopped dancing and then looked at the picture of the one-eyed love of her life. &#x201c;Jack and Niles are going to hang me out to dry for this one,&#x201d; she said sadly, and then she suddenly smiled. &#x201c;But what the hell, Europa, I&#x2019;m fully vested so they can&#x2019;t take my retirement away.&#x201d; This time it was Alice who winked at Lee as he grimaced back from his eight-by-ten glossy. <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Hamilton, should I code-name and secure the file in your private program?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Europa, I also want you to place all files developed on the contents of Vault 22871 with this new file and secure it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Hamilton. Do you wish a code name for the new combined file?&#x201d; Europa asked in her sexy voice that Alice never quite noticed any longer. <br>&#x201c;Yes, code it&#x2014;Grimm.&#x201d; <br>VATICAN CITY, ROME, ITALY <br>The young Vatican counsel held the door open for a young woman. He nodded as she went past. Once outside he placed the black hat on his head and looked around the building. The cybercafe wasn&#x2019;t as crowded as it would be when the students hit just before classes started in less than an hour. <br>As he turned toward Vatican City a mile distant he felt the eyes on him just as he had the day before and then again this morning&#x2014;both times coming to and from his office and then from his office to the cybercafe. Now he was feeling it again. His training was either kicking in or he was starting to lose it. He dipped his head as he passed another young lady on the street. As he did he used the opportunity to glance in the storefront window to his right. Beyond his own reflection of black robe and collar he saw a lone woman about fifty feet behind him. Her gaze seemed just a little too intent on him. He quickened his pace. <br>Crossing St. Peter&#x2019;s Square he felt more secure as the crowds grew thick with tourists and others seeking the comfort of the city. He no longer felt the eyes upon him as he had. As he made his way back to his office inside the Vatican archival building he stopped and leaned down to tie a shoe that needed no tying. He again looked around and his heart froze. Not twenty feet away from where he had stopped that same young woman he had seen on the street was staring right at him. He was tempted to turn and walk toward the girl just to see what reaction he would get, but his training told him to cut and run and then report, let others far above his pay grade make the decisions. He did however reach his cell phone and then he brazenly straightened and started taking pictures like he was a normal tourist. He framed the young woman in his fourth shot of the milling crowd. For good measure he took another just as her face went stern and she turned away. The young Vatican archivist smiled and turned away himself. <br>The man deep undercover at the Vatican, United States Army Second Lieutenant Leonard DeSilva, knew he would have to report to Colonel Collins in Nevada, because if his cover inside the Vatican was blown there was going to be hell to pay. <br>The young priest, who had spent the past year and a half after graduating from Notre Dame fighting for his assignment at the Vatican, knew he would have to call home for instructions&#x2014;and that entailed a call to Department 5656&#x2014;the Event Group. <br>TEL AVIV, ISRAEL <br>Lieutenant General Addis Shamni slowly laid down the report from his agent at the Vatican and then slammed his hand down upon it. He raised that same hand to his forehead and then cursed his bad luck. <br>&#x201c;With everything going on in the world I have to deal with this!&#x201d; he said aloud as his hand left his furrowed brow and slammed into the report once more. &#x201c;How in the hell did someone get a man inside the archives when the Mossad couldn&#x2019;t get into the damn lobby just for a research paper!&#x201d; <br>Lieutenant Colonel Avis Ben-Nevin sat silently in his chair as he listened to the general angrily curse the file in front of him. The colonel with his meticulously trimmed pencil-thin mustache saw the fear in a man&#x2019;s eyes that up until now had never known the feeling. He knew this involved the Vatican, an area the lieutenant colonel had a special and vested interest in. Ben-Nevin was known as the religious factor inside the Mossad. Anything and everything that had to do with religion inside the state of Israel, Ben-Nevin had a firm grasp of it and the event happening at this moment in Italy had a firm hold on the colonel&#x2019;s imagination. <br>&#x201c;Colonel, you may have to get on a plane to Rome and find out exactly what is going on here. I need someone on station that knows just what in the hell they&#x2019;re doing. Young Sorotzkin is one of the best but she may be out of her element where Ramesses is concerned.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perhaps if I could be briefed on Project Ramesses I could&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>The general looked up with an arched graying eyebrow. <br>&#x201c;You could what, read something that could possibly get you killed by someone higher in rank than myself? Colonel, outside of this office that code name is never to be mentioned. Your father knew of it and took it to his grave.&#x201d; The eyes of the general bore into the younger Mossad officer. &#x201c;You are to evaluate the situation with Major Sorotzkin, then report back to me. Nothing is to be done with this American spy. This may be our chance to get into the archives and find out exactly what the Holy Roman Church knows about our history.&#x201d; <br>Ben-Nevin knew he was on the trail that his father had discovered four decades earlier in Hong Kong and the trail just got a little warmer. <br>&#x201c;You are not to bring your normal religious zeal into this mission. Get to Rome, evaluate, and report back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;General, I know I am considered the religious laughingstock around here, but anyone who believes that our religion has nothing to do with how we are viewed, or even perceived in our world, especially our near world, well, that&#x2019;s a bit naive on your part. Our heritage is what makes us strong and any evidence of that heritage we can uncover will go a long way to proving we should reign in this part of the world.&#x201d; <br>General Shamni slowly stood and placed his thick arms on his desk and then leaned forward. &#x201c;Reign, Colonel Ben-Nevin? We are just trying to survive here. If we can be friends with our neighbors through cooperation and mutual respect then that is our goal. Not to point to them and say, <i>&#x2018;See, we were right and you were wrong and God is on our side.</i>&#x2019;&#x201d; This time the general smiled but the gesture was not meant to be sincere in the least. The general hated Ben-Nevin and the colonel knew it. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s one thing our young state has learned, Colonel, is the very real fact that God has never been on anyone&#x2019;s side. As a matter of fact I have come to the conclusion that if he ever was, he&#x2019;s cut the apron strings on us&#x2014;as the Americans like to say. We are too far along to be killing people over these ancient tales.&#x201d; <br>This time Ben-Nevin smiled. &#x201c;This stuff is the manna of our history, proof that we were meant to be here. If Operation Ramesses could prove the world wrong in that regard, why we could&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Enough!&#x201d; This time the hand came down and its impact shook the desk lamp. &#x201c;Colonel, you have pushed and pushed on this very closed loop matter far too long, and the funny thing is I couldn&#x2019;t give you the details of Ramesses even if I knew them. Our policy on the operation has been in place since the time of David Ben-Gurion. And your assertion that Ramesses can save the situation in the Middle East is highly dubious at best, especially since you know nothing of its details. From what I understand Ramesses would do, at least according to our experts, is ignite a wave of religious fundamentalism the likes of which the world has never seen. That cannot happen and will not happen as long as this administration is in place&#x2014;and every administration of whatever political stripe after. Now get to Rome.&#x201d; <br>Ben-Nevin gave the general a halfhearted salute and then turned on his heel. The general didn&#x2019;t see the small smile lift his thin mustache. <br>&#x201c;Sergeant Rosen!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; <br>The general looked up as his assistant popped her head inside the door. <br>&#x201c;Get me the prime minister,&#x201d; was all he said as he inadvertently picked up the field report again and cursed his eyes for reading the words. He didn&#x2019;t acknowledge his assistant as she ducked out of the office. <br>&#x201c;The prime minister is on line one, General.&#x201d; <br>With a minimum of motion the general snatched up the phone and hit the flashing button. <br>&#x201c;Mr. Prime Minister, a trail to our heritage may have been discovered by unknown sources.&#x201d; The general paused to rub the throbbing that had just started coursing through his temples. &#x201c;Sir, we have a problem&#x2014;a three-thousand-year-old nightmare from the past kind of problem.&#x201d; <br>After the general&#x2019;s conversation with the prime minister&#x2019;s office was completed, exactly thirty-two minutes later the elite commando arm of the Israeli Defense Forces; the Sayeret <i>&#x2014;</i>one o...</p><h2>Kunu: Winnebago Boy Escapes (Amazing Indian Children)</h2><p>Following the forced removal of his people from Minnesota to Crow Creek, South Dakota, a Winnebago Indian boy embarks on a dangerous journey to return his dying grandfather to his Minnesota homeland</p><p></p><h2>Educating Deaf Children Bilingually: With Insights &amp; Applications from Sweden &amp; Denmark (Sharing Ideas)</h2><p>Gently loved -- good condition.

She was gowned in a towel from the tub, damp still, the day passing cold, the green fust blown. The city was flattened, looked to be; it was a poster of itself, grainy, famous in any light. He walked her where she could see it, where she could see the breidge, the man on a thread descending, his tiny pointed flame. She saws the hot blue branmble of wleder&#x2019;s sparks fizzing out over the river. Across the river: the fabulous city.<br> He had set screw eyes in the floor. The floor was grooved, adrift with hair, the deep tarry blue of the ocean. He trained the heater on a patch of floor to warm the boards she would lie on. He pulled the towel off, helped her down in stages, onto her knees, her back.<br> The boards were gummy; they smelled of paint. They smelled of his dog who leked in her sleep. She let him tie her wrist and wrist and ankles. As he wished. He arranged her as he wished. He spread out her hair like a headdress, tall, like grass the wind has knocked down. He turned her toes out. he turned her wrists up when he tied her.<br> Something small a bird several wobbled, blown behind her, the flock a scattering of ash in the wind in the cold above the river, the barges moored. The garbage scow. He lifted her head, knotted the scarf at the back of her head, the scarf snug across her eyes, her motehr&#x2019;s scarf, across her mouth and nose. The scarf smelled of her mother. He trained the heater on her, and the cooling fan, oscillating, faint. He lit a candle, tipped it into the wind the fan made, and the wax blew hot, dispersing sparkler, pod, nematocyste, a burn that lights and shrinks. He let the wax ound on the skin of her wrists to merk the place, or seal it: here was the first place he touched her. Here was the mineral seep, the drip in the cave, the years passing. Here a notch where the tendons o fher neck knit into her chest and the wax would catch and pool. He said nothing. He scarcely touched her. Thrust into her once and walked out.<br> She heard him go. Two doors, the last stairs, hello on the the stoop, he was gone.<br> <br></p><h2>Insight: Case Files from the Psychic World</h2><p>A collection of deeply personal tales recounts the psychic author&#39;s experiences during readings throughout the course of her career--encounters that have placed her clients in touch with past lives, lost loved ones, and inheritance claims.

She has been working as a psychic for nearly fifty years, and appears regularly on <i>Montel</i>. She has also appeared on <i>Larry King Live</i>, CNN, and <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>.Based on more than fifty years of helping others, Sylvia Browne's compact primer on the psychic world is impressive. At times sounding like a therapist, at times like a spiritual leader, she has a humanitarian orientation that makes her sound believable and inviting. First she has to review her accomplishments to earn the listener's trust, but she does so with warmth and humility. Sadly, narrator Jeannie Hackett's manner and pace take this material to the edge of smugness. She risks making the author sound like a know-it-all. Still, Hackett moderates her vocal formality with delicacy, and by the end of this fascinating program many listeners will be convinced of the author's legitimacy. T.W. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>What&#39;s in the Deep Blue Sea?</h2><p>Text, flaps, and movable illustrations present a variety of sea creatures, including the jellyfish, sea horse, and octopus.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2-- Bold shapes and vivid colors create exciting backgrounds for these visits to exotic places. In both books, two techniques are used to disclose unusual concealed creatures. Sometimes lifting a flap or two uncovers hidden animals. In other cases, if a leaf is lifted or a cloud brushed away, the beast or bird pops up or flaps his wings. As a finale, an enormous animal bursts from between two pages. This mixture supplies pace, variety, and drama for children who search for the seven animals in each book. Text is spare, a question and answer on each set of double pages: "What's floating through the coral branches? . . . A jiggly jellyfish." Verbs and alliterative adjectives are well chosen. For those who select pop-up books for their collections, this well-designed pair will provide fun for young patrons. --Nancy Seiner, The Carnegie Lib . of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.As with their previous collaborations, What's in the Jungle? and What's in the Cave? , these two pop-up books are absolute delights. Preschoolers with an interest in nature will be immediately drawn in by the simple question on each spread ("What's stomping through the trees?") and eagerly anticipate the answer ("A terrible Triceratops") concealed under the flaps. Carter's bold paintings and clever collages combine with superior paper engineering to move the reader steadily to the final spreads, which feature a bright yellow, red and blue octopus and a pleasingly scary tyrannosaurus. These books are great fun and stand-outs in what seems an increasingly mediocre field.

Its placement on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, along with its fleet of ferries and fishing boats and its position among the farming communities of the Eastern Shore, made it a town of plenty in the lean times of rationing that occurred during the war-and a perfect place for a child to grow up. Portrait of a Town takes the reader on a nostalgic, invigorating journey through Cape Charles with a child&#39;s-eye-view-from playing in a swamp, to jumping the railroad&#39;s coal chute, to fishing the barrier islands that line Virginia&#39;s oceanfront. In this collection of vignettes, Patricia Parsons portrays life in Cape Charles during World War II and beyond. Using her own childhood memories and her family&#39;s life as a powerful touchstone, she follows the town&#39;s period of prosperity into a period of decline that transformed it from a bustling commercial center to a forsaken backwater-and back again. Recently, this historic town has experienced revitalization, rising from its own ashes to become a family-style tourist destination. Today, Cape Charles beckons you to explore-and see why it truly is a memorable town.</p><p></p><h2>Aliens vs. Predator Omnibus Volume 2</h2><p>Mankind's most lethal adversaries battle for supremacy, and whoever wins &#x2014; we lose.

To do this, it is essential to understand what took place between Christ and his disciples. In numerous lecture cycles, Rudolf Steiner spoke about the inner community of the disciples, opening up perspectives that help us see how the disciples accompanied Christ Jesus during the three years of his earthly life and after the Resurrection. Especially in his lectures on the Fifth Gospel, Steiner shed light on the community of the disciples from the viewpoint of the processes of human consciousness that were intimately involved in the events at the beginning of the new era and were inscribed in the chronicle of evolution, the akashic record.<br><br>In this book, Dr. Peter Selg presents the most illuminating details of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s research into the hidden events that took place between Christ and his disciples. For three years the disciples were close to Christ. They shared his life; they were there when he performed healings, and even when he prayed. These events and the instructions they received from Christ, often within their own intimate circle, away from public view, form a significant part not only of the four Gospels but also of the Mystery of Golgotha itself.<br><br>In view of the challenges to consciousness that we are facing now in our times, it seems urgently important that we study this inner community revealed by Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s research which found &#x201c;the great new dawn that showed them the way after Pentecost.&#x201d; <br><br><b>Contents:</b> <br><ol> <li>Finding the Disciples</li> <li>Christ&#x2019;s Activity in the Circle of Disciples</li> <li>Gethsemane and Golgotha</li> <li>The Disciples of the Risen One</li> <li>Ascension and Pentecost</li> </ol> <br>This volume is a translation from German of <i>Christus und die J�nger: Vom Schicksal der inneren Gemeinschaft</i> (Ita Wegman Institut 2009).</p><p><b>Peter Selg</b>&nbsp;was born in 1963 in Stuttgart and studied medicine in Witten-Herdecke, Zurich, and Berlin.

Scholars address a range of topics, from basic aspects of osteological analysis to advanced ?research focused on Kennewick Man&#x2019;s origins and his relationships to other populations.

I slept through both World Wars and the tainted calm between. It was as if I had been cursed by an evil fairy, pricked by an enchanted spinning wheel; an impenetrable briar had gripped my mind."</p><p>Thus begins Rikki Ducornet's brilliant lyric novel about Nicolas who, as a result of witnessing his mother's murder, falls into a decades-long coma. Awakened in a seaport town in France, he reconstructs his past through storytelling and myth, resulting in an astonishing exploration of memory and imagination.</p></p><p>Rikki Ducornet was born in New York and has lived in North Africa, South America, Canada and France. Her work as an illustrator first came to the attention of the Canadian book trade in 1974 with the publication of Susan Musgrave's "Gullband". In 1983, the Porcupine's Quill commissioned Rikki to illustrate an edition of Jorge Luis Borges' "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius".<p>Rikki is the author of three short-story collections, seven books of poetry, and seven novels, including "The Fan-Maker's Inquisition" and "The Jade Cabinet". She is also a painter whose work has been exhibited widely. She currently lives in Denver, Colorado.</p>In a richly imagined, often Rabelaisian journey through dreams and the past, novelist/illustrator Ducornet in this, the third in her projected ``tetralogy of elements'' (The Stain, The Entering Fire), explores memory and being. Sleeping through two world wars in the spa run by the renowned psychoanalyst Dr. Venus Kaiserstiege (or K), Nicholas--the Sandman of the case study The Fountains of Neptune--awakens to a very different world. As he tends the now-rundown spa, Nicholas tries to ``put order to my memories, disentangling reality from dreams and Heaven from Hell. These days I do nothing but attempt to interpret those enigmatic wheels, those churning shadows, those cries beyond cries; the story beneath all stories: my own.'' He recalls his childhood in a small seaside French town, the fantastic tales that old sailors told him, and the hints that his parents' deaths were not accidental. The Sandman's big sleep began when, at the age of nine on a visit to a riverside village, he accidentally fell into the water and nearly drowned. The accident, K suggests, was precipitated by his increasing awareness of the fatal romantic triangle in which his parents were involved. His recovery, a febrile re-creation of a lost childhood, is interspersed with essay-like letters to and from K, on a book tour in the US. K dies soon after her return, and the Sandman is left ``to dwell in animated quietude'' and to reflect. Interested only in the ``allusive messages'' of his dreams, he feels that he ``is very like the floating monster both of the world and not of the world-- as long as I can hold fast the glass wand of reverie--somehow eternal.'' Vivid characters and remarkable writing, but while most of the parts are good, there is something in the sum that echoes old ideas and stories. Interesting if flawed. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They&#x2019;re both outsiders. They both have secrets. And try as she might to avoid him, Laura finds herself drawn to Leon&#x2019;s quiet boldness as surely as she is driven to find out more about her home&#x2019;s enigmatic former owner. Together they probe the mysteries of the Visconti House, making an exploration into the past that will change their lives &#x2014; and open their hearts &#x2014; forever.</p><p>Elsbeth Edgar has worked as a teacher and a librarian. When her children were young she started writing stories for them, following their interests as they moved from dinosaurs, dragons, and furry animals to school experiences and relationships. She lives in Melbourne, Australia.Gr 5-8-Two lonely grade-eight kids in rural Australia develop a friendship as they work together to unlock a mystery. Laura feels like an outcast because of her family&#39;s artist lifestyle, her curly hair and bushy eyebrows, and the decaying mansion she calls home. Leon, newer to the area, is ostracized for living with his grandmother, the rumors that circulate about his father being in prison, and his shabby appearance. The friendship between the two progresses slowly because Laura, desperate to fit in, is embarrassed to be seen with Leon. As they work together to uncover the history of Laura&#39;s house and Mr. Visconti-its original owner-and his tragic love story, Laura learns to understand the value of friendship. Part realistic fiction, part mystery, and part romance, Edgar&#39;s first novel is a good blend of simple prose and descriptive imagery and language, and the story behind Mr. Visconti and the house offers some interesting twists. Readers will identify with Laura&#39;s desire to fit in and root for the friendship that develops between the two characters.-Adrienne L.

The author, one of Great Britain's most noted warship experts, profiles vessels that achieved notoriety due to outlandish design or appearance and others that were lost in dramatic actions or by accidents. Also covered are warships that never endeared themselves to operators, and, as a consequence, suffered prejudice against their design. The author contends that few ships are incompetently designed but rather victims of flawed operational concepts, over-ambitious specifications, poorly designed weapons systems, or financial stringency. Among ships included in the book are the Russian Popoffkas; the French battleship <i>Brennus</i>; the British vessels <i>Captain, Sheffield</i>, and <i>Invincible</i>; the U.S. monitors <i>Katahdin</i> and <i>Vesuvius</i>; and the Japanese light cruiser <i>Mogami</i>.

This is a book you'll devour all at once-from the safety of your umbrella!" -Jessica Khoury, author of <em>Origin</em> and <em>Vitro</em> </p></p><p>Virginia Bergin is the author of H2O, which The Horn Book Magazine called &#34;Inspiring.&#34; She lives in Bristol (UK).<p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p>I was sinking.</p> <p>That's how it is when you're all alone and there's been a global apocalypse and you're just hoping your dad is going to show up like he said he would but there's no sign of him so what exactly are you going to do if your dad doesn't come and every day you try hard not to think about that because... </p> <p>Everything's going to be OK</p> <p>is what you have to keep telling yourself but some part of you or maybe it's all of you thinks it isn't going to be OK so you try not to think at all but you can't stop thinking because pretty much everyone is dead and you've got nowhere to go and no one to go anywhere with and anyway who wants to go anywhere when THE SKY IS RAINING DEATH?</p> <p>Yes, in an apocalypse-type situation, it's very easy to think bad things. In fact, there's SO much time for thinking, it's really easy to slide way beyond even regular apocalypse-type thinking into TOTAL COMPLETE AND UTTER DOOM THINKING...because there's about a million days when you're stuck inside because it's raining killer rain or it looks like it's going to rain killer rain or you just can't face another day in the library.</p> <p>Yup, that's how bad things got: I broke into Dartbridge Public Library. Studying up on clouds (I know twenty-four different types!) didn't seem like it was going to be enough to get me through this thing. (Through it and into what? That was a whole other question, one best not asked.) My specialist areas of study were:</p> <p>1. The self-help section. Oddly, there didn't seem to be that much on feeling a bit gloomy because human life on Earth as we know it has been wiped out-but you could tell people meant well. Ruby usefulness rating: 4/10.</p> <p>2. Microbiology for people who quit biology at the end of eighth grade, weren't really all that interested in science, and weren't any good at it anyway. It's baffling and creepy. Ruby rating: 1/10.</p> <p>3. Car maintenance for people who would have dropped that too if they'd tried to teach it to us in school (which they should have done). I would not have chosen to study this, but something happened. I'll explain later. Ruby rating: 10/10.</p> <p>4. Survival manuals. Frankly, I could have learned most of this stuff when I was in Girl Scouts, but I tended to opt for the cake-making side of things (the benefits seemed more obvious at the time). However, not even the SAS (the Special Air Service = very, very good-at-surviving-stuff British Army crack force), who have handy tips on surviving a nuclear bomb going off right next to you, seem to have been able to have imagined this particular kind of disaster. Or maybe they did, but when people saw the chapter on how the army would abandon anyone they had no use for and we'd all be left to fend for ourselves, they complained that it was an outrage and a lie and the SAS were forced to take it out. (Even though it was TRUE.) Nevertheless, Ruby rating: 7/10 (because you never know).</p> <p>5. Oh, and...one particularly sad and lonely day, I had a quick look at cellular telecommunications. There are no phones and no Internet anymore, so I was just curious, I suppose, about how difficult it'd be to build and run a thing like that. (Quite difficult, I think. Judging from the diagrams.) Ruby rating: 0/10.</p> <p>My cell phone is at the top of a list of all the things there'll be no more of (currently 402 items long with the recent shock addition of chocolate spread; I was scooping the last fingerful out from under the rim of a jar when I realized supplies will eventually run out).</p> <p>There are no people on this list. Their names, the names of the dead, are written on my heart. My small, sad, human heart. Hurt so bad it will never cry again.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I cry. I cry plenty. I howl! But my heart? It is all cried out. It is silent.</p> <p>I don't do pets anymore either. Apart from the risk that a single sloppy lick from a puddle drinker could kill you, they're nothing but heartbreak and trouble...and they're ganging up. There are probably small, mean teams of guinea pigs and rabbits, but the dogs are certainly hanging out together-I've seen packs of them roaming-and I've even seen loose affiliations of cats. Not Ruby, though-that's Mrs. Wallis's Siamese; she doesn't affiliate herself with anyone. She's still hanging around in a strictly unaffiliated sort of way, and she seems to be doing OK, though I sincerely hope her well-fed appearance has got nothing to do with the disappearance of Mrs. Wallis's shih tzu Mimi (last seen absconding from a car in the school parking lot and running in the direction of home), or indeed with the disappearance of Mrs. Wallis herself.</p> <p>There is a shorter list of things I'm glad there'll be no more of, currently twelve items long. Exams come top, which I never would-"come top of the class," geddit?-so that's why they are numero uno. This list is a lot harder to think of stuff for, so it's brilliant when I do come up with something. The last time I thought of something-"No one can stop me from drinking whatever I like whenever I like!"-I drank to celebrate. I hit my mom's gin.</p> <p>I remember standing, swaying, at the open front door, watching the rain pour down. I think I was talking to it. I wouldn't have been saying nice things.</p> <p>When I woke up the next morning, alive, I crossed the drink thing off the list.</p> <p>The thing about going a little crazy is it's hard to realize that's what's happening.</p> <p>I stopped going to the library. (What do the SAS know? They're buffoons!) I stopped doing anything much, other than things I absolutely had to do-and even my grip on those got a bit shaky. I'd get up and think, I must clean my teeth...and it'd be bedtime before I got around to it-although bedtime itself got a little flexible. Sometimes it happened in the middle of the day; sometimes it happened all day. And sometimes, when it was supposed to be bedtime, because it was the middle of the night, it didn't happen at all.</p> <p>One such night, I shaved my hair off. All of it. It seemed easier to do that than wash it. Easier, even, than trying to find a can of dry shampoo with anything left in it-when in any case, just like chocolate spread, supplies will run out eventually, so why not face facts? That's what I imagine I was thinking...when really I don't remember thinking anything much, just picking up my (looted) battery-powered lady shaver...and watching grubby clump-lettes of (dyed) black hair fall.</p> <p>It should have been the head shaving that alerted me to how serious my situation was. Bit of a clue there. But all I ended up doing was adding the result to one of my other lists: the list of stupid things I've done.</p> <p>That one's not written down either; it's just burned on my brain. It hurts.</p> <p>My shaved head looked like a small, fuzzy globe, a planet...inside which strange things happened. Below the spiky surface, dark, wordless thoughts massed, rose, and sunk. Popped up again, doing the backstroke. Giggling. Or hidden deep in the goo of my mind, screaming messages that bubbled up, garbled.</p> <p>All day, every day, all night, every night, my head simmered with nonsense. Sometimes it boiled. Until finally, there didn't seem to be anything very much left inside my head at all. Boiled dry, I guess. I don't think the thoughts had words anymore. First off, even the sensible, normal ones got texty: "I must clean my teeth" became "clean teeth." Then it was just "teeth." Then, when the words had pretty much stopped altogether, it was probably just "."</p> <p>I was lost on Planet Ruby, where weeks and days and hours and minutes and seconds (there were some very long seconds) got muddled-and dreams and reality got muddled too. And nightmares, but they were pretty much only about as awful as what was real.</p> <p>And it might have all gone on and on like that until I really did walk out in the rain (then it would stop), but finally SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ALERT ME TO HOW SERIOUS MY SITUATION WAS... </p> <p>I crashed a Ferrari. Totaled it.</p> <p>I was flooring it, coming around a bend (up on Dartmoor, I was about to realize), when I hit a patch of mist, part of which turned out not to be mist but a sheep, so I swerved and-</p> <p>SCREECH!</p> <p>KA-BLAM!</p> <p>BOUFF!</p> <p>The airbag thing smashed into my face. Only somehow my own hands had gotten involved.</p> <p>OK, I know how. I like to do this fancy cross-hands thing when I'm turning corners. So, yeah, my own arms got biffed into my face by the airbag.</p> <p>I sat there. Punched face screaming. Dazed-double dazed, because you want to know a terrible thing? I wasn't even sure about how I'd gotten there. I mean, I must have thought I should get out of the house for a bit-to go on an I-need-something-to-drink mission, most probably. (Supplies always seemed to be running low, but that was probably because time was running weird: one minute I'd have plenty of cola or whatever, and the next minute I'd be draining dregs and panicking.) But since I often thought I should do something and didn't do it or thought something had happened when it hadn't actually happened, I was seriously shocked to realize that this crash thing, apparently, had really happened. Though I only knew it for sure because IT HURT. OWWW. ARRRGH. OWWWWW.</p> <p>WAKE UP, RUBY! WAKE UP!</p> <p>The car was wrecked; I didn't even have to try to start it again-which I did-to know that. It had made out with a wall. They didn't like each other. Not one bit.</p> <p>I got out of the car. My eyes were already stinging like something nasty had been flung into them. I put my hand up to my bashed nose and felt blood. I looked at the blood on my fingertips; then I squinted at the thing that would like to eat that blood.</p> <p>Mist's a funny old thing, isn't it? Basically, it's just a cloud that's hit rock bottom. A cloud (stratus nebulosus, doncha know) that can no longer be bothered to get up into the sky. It drags its sorry self along the ground. Funny? It's hilarious, really: Is it going to kill you, or isn't it? How much of it-exactly-would have to settle on your skin before... </p> <p>I could see that mist swirling and swelling toward me. I should have gotten back into the car and waited it out...but I have an emotional issue about being trapped in a car-particularly, in this case, one that had just SMASHED into a wall; probably anyone left alive in Devon would have heard that crash. Some scary someone-anyone could have been on their way to investigate. So-add this to the list of stupid things!-I didn't wait. I ran.</p> <p>All I could think was: it was coming after me. But I could outrun it.</p> <p>I bolted across the moor. I scrambled up-up-up. Up rocks. Up-up-up. Up-up-up. Stupid-stupid-stupid Ruby. Up-up-up.</p> <p>Until there was no more up.</p> <p>I knew I was at the top of Hay Tor not because I'm, like, really keen on long, rambling walks in scenic landscapes, but because there was no place higher to go; anyone who lives in Dartbridge knows this place because you can see it for miles around-when it's clear.</p> <p>I stood on the rocks, where there was no place up-no place, no other or farther or higher place-watching the mist rise around me, puffing itself up like it was just remembering it could be a cloud that could get on up into that sky and rain.</p> <p>I wiped at my throbbing nose, saw blood on the back of my hand. What if it could smell it? What if all those little wiggly-legged bacterium ET microblobs could smell my blood? What if they were all now paddling away like mad, waving their little tentacles, letting out little microsqueals of joy at the scent of breakfast?</p> <p>I didn't know how that would be, having that thing, that disgusting little blood-gobbling, world-murdering thing get me slowly.</p> <p>Bad? Very bad? Unimaginably, excruciatingly bad?</p> <p>And lonely.</p> <p>I was going to die alone on Hay Tor. My body would be pecked at by crows, nibbled on by sheep bored of grass. Foxes would come and have a good old chew on my bones-maybe drag a few back to the den for the cubs. Someone someday would put my rain-eaten, worm-licked, weather-worn skull on top of the highest stone, and Hay Tor would get a whole new name: Stupid Dead Girl Hill.</p> <p>I stood. I roared.</p> <p>No, that's just what I'd like to say I did.</p> <p>I lost it.</p> <p>I stood and I whimpered, and in the mist in front of me through stinging, weeping eyes, I saw the shadow of a someone-anyone. Fear crackled through me.</p> <p>No one moved.</p> <p>And they'd die if they stayed there, swallowed by the mist-and I felt my arms waving and I heard my own wrecked voice shouting, "COME ON!"</p> <p>And the shadow-being waved back. She waved back.</p> <p>And I saw she was me and wasn't real at all.</p> <p>And I sat down on the rocks, weeping.</p> <p>And the shadow girl sat too...and melted. She went away. Almost as quickly as she had appeared, she disappeared.</p> <p>I knew what she was. I'd seen her in the cloud book. A rare thing-called a "brocken specter," when you see your own shadow in a cloud. Enough to spook anyone out. More than enough to spook me.</p> <p>The mist went with her-the shadow ghost of me-burning off in the sun, until I was just a stupid girl with a punched face, sitting alone on Hay Tor.</p> <p>Wake up, Ruby Morris.</p></p><h2>Queen Victoria</h2><p>Lytton Strachey&#x2019;s captivating portrait of Queen Victoria is considered a masterpiece of the biographer&#x2019;s art.</p><p>Written in 1921, Lytton Strachey&#x2019;s <b>Queen Victoria</b> revolutionized the art of biography by using elements of romantic fiction and melodrama to create a warm, humorous, and very human portrait of an iconic figure. We see Victoria as a strong&#x2013;willed child with a famous temper, as the eighteen&#x2013;year&#x2013;old girl&#x2013;Queen, as a monarch, wife, mother, and widow. Equally fascinating are the depictions of her relationships: with her governess &#x201c;precious Lehzen,&#x201d; with Peel, Gladstone, and Disraeli, with her beloved Albert, and, in later life, her legendary devotion to her Highland servant John Brown, all of which illuminate an altogether different side to Victoria&#x2019;s staid, pious image.Lytton Strachey (1880&#x2013;1932), one of the most famous writers of his time, was a prominent member of the Bloomsbury set and pioneer of a new style of biography. He is the author of, among others <i>Landmarks</i>, <i>Eminent Victorians,</i> and <i>Elizabeth and Essex.</i></p><h2>More Parts</h2><p>children</p><p></p><h2>Rethinking Nature: Essays in Environmental Philosophy (Studies in Continental Thought)</h2><p><p>Rethinking Nature brings the voices of leading Continental philosophers into discussion about what is emerging as one of our most pressing and timely concerns&#x2015;the environmental crisis facing our planet.

When the flames have died down, all the coals are covered with gray ash, and the temperature is hot (you can hold your hand 6 inches above the grill for only 2 to 3 seconds), you&#x2019;re ready to cook.<br><br> In a small bowl, combine the spices and salt to taste and mix well. Rub the steaks all over with the oil and then with the rub, pressing gently to be sure it adheres.&nbsp;<br><br> Put the steaks on the grill directly over the coals, and cook until done to your liking, about 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium rare. To check for doneness, cut into the thickest steak and peek to see if the meat is slightly less done than you want it to be when you eat it.&nbsp;<br><br> Transfer the steaks to a cutting board, tent them loosely with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes or so.

J. Cherryh and Jane Fancher&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sail ho!" the cry was, and Capt. Jarez Camargen of the <i>Widowmaker</i> climbed to the masthead himself with his best glass, sweeping the dawn sea.A day and night of treacherous shifts and tricks, and now, with the wind off the starboard quarter, the <i>Widowmaker's</i> best sailing point, there she was, their chase, the Yenized ship <i>Fortunate,</i> sail above the horizon."Ho, Cap'n!" came from his lieutenant, below. "No longer quite as <i>Fortunate,</i> eh?"Camargen grinned, a wicked and wolfish sort of grin. <i>Widowmaker</i> was, to put it in the very best light, a pirate. Her prey had run her every trick in a thick old book, and here they were again, out of the isles and onto the southern coast.They were a Yenized polacre xebec themselves, the <i>Widowmaker</i> --at least Yenized-built, before they'd taken her in the Isles. Capt. Camargen had liked the look of her: long, low-waisted, a pretty set to her lateen sails fore and aft, her bastard mizzen, which gave her power, and quick, oh, much better in his able hands than in the hands of the fool that had left her largely unmanned and anchored off Keina's Head. Her former captain had been taking on wateron that island when they'd seen black smoke billowing up from the harbor and their sweet xebec standing out to sea under all sail. The <i>Happy Isle,</i> she'd been, under a fool; but <i>Widowmaker</i> she'd become, and she had a nose for treasure--had a sure, keen nose, these days, wizardguided, since they'd met up with old Hada Korgun and his grievance, and used him for a weathervane.There he was, out under the bowsprit, incorruptible, as good a guide as a pirate's instinct to the whereabouts of the <i>Fortunate.</i> They didn't check him often, but he was there, arm outstretched, glassy eyes open, mouth still stretched wide with his dying curse, and where he pointed, there they sailed.There was a Yenizedi wizard on board the <i>Fortunate,</i> likely in better shape. And they'd tried the soft approach--used <i>Widowmaker's</i> Yenized-built outlines and her old Yenizedi flag to get close to the <i>Fortunate</i> the first time, but that trick would never work twice. Hada Korgun had laid his curse, burst his heart doing it, and now forget all the old bastard had said about duty to the king of Enlibar and the pardon they'd get if they only got his treasure back. A dead wizard didn't keep promises any better than a live king, and Camargen never had liked that part of the bargain.The <i>Fortunate</i> carried a number of items along with a scoundrel of a Yenized wizard, a man after Camargen's own heart, who'd stolen this treasure from Hada Korgun by an act of hospitality betrayed ... clever man, who had a very well-known ruby, the Heart of Fire, along with a book of spells and a gold-headed wand.The Enlibrite, Hada Korgun, had lost his court job over that theft, the ruby being the property of the king of Enlibar. He desperately wanted his king's property back, along with the head of the offender, that being the condition of his reinstatement. He'd approached them in the free port of Anbec, offered them considerable inducement topursue the fugitive--for starters--and claimed the magical ability to track this prize.All this was useful until they had the ship in sight and Korgun tried some rite or another attempting to link the two ships. He died in the magical backlash--died, or something like it. The crew had lashed him to the mast and kept him there four days, in the hopes he'd come around and blast the ship that now ran them a merry chase. His arm moved. Where that ship went, when it tacked or wore, it tracked, no matter the weather. But he'd begun to have an effect on the crew, just standing there in the way of hands on business, and it seemed less and less likely he'd come to and be himself again.So they'd lashed him under the bowsprit, down where hands bound for the head could look out and wish him a good day, if they wanted. At night he had a wan kind of bluish glow about him, and for his part, Capt. Camargen would just as soon cut him free for fish bait, being averse to wizardry from the start and convinced by a long shot he didn't need a wizard-compass to run down a bloody great Yenizeder merchantman in the middle of the ocean.But the captain of that vessel was a right seaman, no question. They'd used all their tricks on each other, setting out decoys at night, muffling up their wizard-compass with sailcloth and dousing all lights to creep closer on a following breeze. They'd gotten the most of every wind that would serve, crept through a maze of islands and chartless reefs, turned tricks of light and weather, and all he'd done had kept the bastard from any civilized port, at least. Run as he would, every time he came close to land, he'd gotten between and chased him out to sea.They'd be rich. The law of the Brotherhood was share and share alike, and they'd be rich when they ran that beggar down.So the crew put up with misery, put up with a chase that dragged into days and weeks, into calms and blows andheat and frozen, deadly rigging. The deep calms had set them in sight of one another, the weed growing thick on both their bottoms, until they both sailed like slugs, and no time for either of them to heave down and scrape clean. The chase took on a nightmare slowness at times, every scrap of sail aloft and the log running slower, slower, while they blazed away at one another with Yenized Fire, and flung glass bombs, trying to set sails or pitch-soaked wood ablaze. Crew were scarred with burns, to a man.Then they reached latitudes where storms grew deadly icicles in the maintop, that plunged to deck and dented the planks, where men took horrible falls, and thus far survived them. "'Cause he's dead, we ain't," was the common wisdom, and the crew didn't want to look at their wizard--all frozen up with icicles, one report said, but still moving--but they had acquired a superstitious belief that old Korgun was their luck as well as their compass.A sensible captain might have called it enough. <i>Widowmaker's</i> situation had gotten desperate, running them low on provisions and on water, the bitter latitudes wearing the already thin sails and rigging to a perilous state. At times they thought they'd have lost their quarry, and Captain Camargen began to think of ordering the <i>Widowmaker</i> to some wooded shore, some foreign port where they might forget the foolishness and get it out of their blood.But there was that damned wizard-compass up under the bow, their figurehead. And just when they thought they'd lost her, there was the thrice-damned <i>Fortunate.</i> At times a glass showed her clearly, let them see that cursed Yenizedi wizard walking around, talking to the crew, sometimes just lingering back by the stern and watching them, just watching, silver hair streaming in the wind--a live wizard, to their dead one."We can find other prey," Capt. Camargen had said. Even he had a conscience, and when water itself ran short, when they could take no time to send boats ashore: "We'redown to a ton of water," he told the assembled crew, "and even the hardtack is running slim.""We ain't et all the rats, yet," the crew shouted back. "We're goin' on, Cap'n!"The log itself had gone strange. What Capt. Camargen thought he'd written turned out written differently when he checked his course. His charts showed frayed and lost lettering just where it might have been most useful.But now they were closer than they had been in weeks. The <i>Fortunate</i> was hull-up, and lagging, the wind deserting her sails as she bore close to a shore where the charts warned of reefs and shoals, another of her tricks, but not one she could play to great advantage: The <i>Widowmaker</i> could skin through channels where the <i>Fortunate</i> risked her bottom, and a xebec's sails gave her much more maneuverability in the tricks of wind.Around a headland, skimming close, close to shore, and now there seemed to be a spot on the lens. Capt. Camargen closed the glass, polished the lens with his cuff, and tried again.Not a spot, after all. A spot of bluish haze, the sort of color that ought to belong on the horizon, but that had set down on the sea, right near that coast, and the sea beyond it all wrinkled with wind.Camargen snapped the glass shut and glared, not needing a glass now to see that situation, the dog.They had the wind off their starboard quarter, carrying them along at a good rate, no danger of a lee shore while this wind blew, but that riffling of the blue water out there was a white squall of the sort infamous in the southern sea, a brutal shift in the wind, in this case bearing right toward the coast, and the <i>Fortunate</i> sailing right along that coast. The <i>Fortunate</i> had that squall in their sights, too. Had it in their sights, bloody hell! That blackguard wizard might have stirred it up as a favor to the captain.Hammer and anvil, the coast for the anvil and the squallfor the hammer, and them a good long ways behind. The <i>Fortunate</i> was meaning to skin through, pass by that deadly rocky headland before the squall came sweeping down on that coast, and leave them in her wake. It intended the squall to cut them off, to force them to veer out to sea and sail wide of the weather.They were both short of water and short of rations, damn them, and if the <i>Widowmaker</i> had to turn out to sea, she had as well turn around and go back to the Isles, her prey escaped, all this long chase for nothing.That or a long, thankless search in every cove and inlet on this impoverished, treeless coast, for a ship taking on water.Crew had seen it too--exhausted crew that had been hauling up glass bombs and fitting the cables to the catapult. Some tried to point to the situation."Carly!" Camargen yelled for the bosun. "All aloft. Mizzen royal, storm trysails! Gunners, shift everything forward!"Carly stared at him half a heartbeat, the whole intention implicit in those orders. The pipe shrilled. There was a moment's awful hesitation, old hands knowing full well what the game was: It was in their eyes. But then they howled with one voice, "Camargen or the devil!" and top hands swarmed aloft to spread all the canvas she had, while gunners worked like devils to shift their light catapults to the forecastle to back up the bowchasers.Camargen dived down to the xebec's little cabin for another look at his charts. The shore was notorious for its hidden reefs. In sight of the shoreline, he had his landmark in the headland itself, and he set everything in memory well as he could, because they might sail on their wind right across the teeth of that squall, much faster than the <i>Fortunate</i> on this point of sailing, and they were going to have to run up the <i>Fortunate's</i> backside and come under fire from that towering deck in order to clear that space of coast before the squall swept them onto the reefs. The crewsaw their prize; they cheered the choice they saw. They knew they could overhaul that bastard. If they could withstand the fire she could throw long enough and not sink her, they could board and take her.The crew was mad with desire, seeing gold for every man jack of them; and now he might have caught the contagion himself ... hell, if he'd fall off now and let that Yenizedi dog skin past, laughing at them. Wizard or no wizard aboard that ship, they had old Korgun up there for a charm, and they were going to take that Yenizeder bastard this time.He ran up on deck, already feeling the difference in the ship's motion with the new sails abroad, and hoping their weather-worn canvas held ... that was the devil in it, because if something carried away, they might not have the speed to make it past that squall. Fool, something said to him, reminding him there was still escape. Fool, no treasure is worth it. But there was no hesitation in the crew at all, who worked like madmen. Catapults brought to the forecastle were bowsed up to the fine, fair view of a square-rigged ship coming closer and closer, as the <i>Widowmaker's</i> full spread of canvas hurled her along the fine line between that squall and hidden rocks.Thought I didn't have the charts, did you? he asked his enemy. Thought we'd not have the nerve? The <i>Widowmaker</i> ripped along, rigging singing, the whole deck humming. Old Korgun was getting a soaking up there, the bow wave sending up continuous spray, so that the gunners had to canvas their catapults' cables and shield their slowmatches from the wet.Closer and closer, with the white squall a haze on their larboard bow, and the <i>Fortunate</i> towering up ahead of them. No need for the glass now. A blind man could see the tall stern of their enemy, could see one head and another take a look at them over the taffrail--could see activity back there and know that they were preparing their own rain of fire and missiles, and their deck so high they didn'thave to worry about the spray. A silver-haired man leaned on the rail up there--Yenizedi, no question, and their wizard. Wind caught that hair and spread it like a banner."Off covers!" Camargen shouted at his gunners. "Fire at will!"Canvas came off. Bombs were heaved up and settled into their padded slots, their fuses set alight, and <i>thump-thump-thump!</i> the catapults cut loose, two at once and the others close after, the glass bombs flying. One smacked against their enemy's stern-post, one fell in the sea, and others hit near the rail. Silver-hair vanished for a moment and reappeared.The gunners worked like fiends, angling up for maximum loft, winching back, no longer in unison. It was a race, and the first went off, then two and three so close they made one <i>thump,</i> sailing up and over the enemy's rail, spreading fire. The fourth hit the rail itself, right where Silver-hair was standing. The heavy bomb splintered the rail and spattered fire.Silver-hair's robe caught. He made a futile gesture to put it out, turned in a sheet of fire, and in a gust of wind, lost his footing and fell, his black robes and pale hair a downward trail, a small flutter of fire amid the dark cloak."Ha!" the gunners crowed."Get that bugger!" Camargen roared to midships, and junior officers and spare gunners rushed to the rail to seize up two of the xebec's long oars from their stowage. They ran them out, while the gunners kept lobbing bombs at their target, and now bombs came back, belated fire from a towering great merchantman. Bombs burst on the deck and made puddles of fire that spread in the watery sheet of spray as crew ran to dowse them and wash them overboard.Camargen dodged between two such and saw the wretch hauled in, half drowned and snagged between crossed oars.Silver-hair it was, but not the old wizard, not wearing any great ruby, but a young man, a drowned duck of ayoung man who coughed up water and had to be hauled up to his feet, streaming water."He's not the one," Camargen said as the thump of catapults went on and an enemy missile exploded off the mainmast. "Search him for valuables and pitch the bastard in the hold.""Fool!" the drowned man cried. "You're caught, we're all caught, we're all gone mad! Turn back! Turn back now or we're cursed, all of us are cursed!"The hands had their superstitions.

Bernier (Words of Fire, Deeds of Blood, 1989, etc.) takes on the challenging task of sorting out the threads of the confusing political, social, economic, and aesthetic fabric of a society that in some ways was at its peak and, in others, was near dissolution. The title refers to ``the last great assertion of European (and French) cultural and social superiority''--an excellence in fashion (Schiaparelli), art (Picasso, Mir�, Dali), literature (Gide, Malraux), and diplomacy (Elsa Maxwell and US Ambassador William Bullitt). But Paris, the most powerful cultural center in Europe, enjoying a peace and prosperity that were rapidly disappearing in other parts of the world, also offered a special style of life, glamorous and pleasure-oriented--a society of costume balls, nightclubs, theaters, opera; a world of display and innovation that included everything from autos to yo-yos. The ``other Paris'' of the music hall (Josephine Baker and Maurice Chevalier), brothels, and sidewalk caf&#x201a;s was equally festive, providing escape from the poverty, alienation, unemployment, class conflict, and political despair that afflicted the masses. Those who cared periodically but ineffectually rioted over the political corruption, while an inept government became an easy target for the Nazis, with whom some French aristocrats had been socializing. Poignant and incisive, Bernier, with a journalist's eye for meaningful detail, captures this confused era when the City of Light, at its brightest, was overcome by a political darkness from which it never recovered. (Thirty b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This is a richly detailed and immensely readable overview of the social, artistic, and political life in Paris during a brilliant decade of extraordinary cultural achievement. Bernier, a prolific author, art historian, and leading authority on French history, juxtaposes the richness and, at times, frivolity of life among the Parisian glitterati with the menacing storm clouds of foreign affairs and the deepening economic and political divisions within France itself. Although the mass of the population was excluded from the social whirl involving Chanel, Schiaparelli, Dali, Picasso, and Gide, and the flowering of the arts contrasted sharply with the increasing incompetence of a government engaged in what the author terms "a dance of the ministries," Bernier argues that the Thirties represented the last brilliant moment for Paris as a world capital of civilization. While his tone is at times condemnatory, he argues that the French took pride in their brilliant social life, seeing it as the one last area where France still led the world. Bernier completes his poignant tale with an epilog on how Parisian life changed with the onset of war.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy.

In December 1783, General Washington, the most powerful man in the country, stepped down as Commander in Chief and returned to private life at Mount Vernon. Yet as Washington contentedly grew his estate, the fledgling American experiment floundered. Under the Articles of Confederation, the weak central government was unable to raise revenue to pay its debts or reach a consensus on national policy. The states bickered and grew apart. When a Constitutional Convention was established to address these problems, its chances of success were slim. Jefferson, Madison, and the other Founding Fathers realized that only one man could unite the fractious states: George Washington. Reluctant, but duty-bound, Washington rode to Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 to preside over the Convention.</p><p>Although Washington is often overlooked in most accounts of the period, this masterful new history from Pulitzer Prize-winner Edward J.

Larson masterfully chronicles how George Washington saved the United States by coming out of retirement four years after the War of Independence to lead a country on the brink of dissolution and secure its future. Though the period between the Revolution and the Presidency has previously been neglected in studies of Washington's life, Larson's striking reassessment shows that Washington's greatness in fact rests on these years&#x2014;1783 to 1789&#x2014;and rightfully elevates our foremost Founding Father's "forgotten years" to a central place in the American story. </p><p>In December 1783, Washington, the most powerful and popular man in America, stepped down as commander in chief and returned to private life as a farmer and landowner. Yet as Washington found happiness in successfully growing his Virginia estate, the fledgling American experiment foundered under the Articles of Confederation. Sectional bickering paralyzed government; debts went unpaid; the economy stagnated; national security was neglected; the union of states was in peril.</p><p>When a Constitutional Convention was called to forge a new government, its chances of success were slim. Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and other leaders realized only one American&#x2014;the retired hero George Washington&#x2014;could unite the fractious states. After months of anguish, Washington answered the call and left his beloved Mount Vernon in the spring of 1787 to preside over the convention in Philadelphia. Although Washington is overlooked in most accounts, Larson brilliantly uncovers Washington's vital role in shaping the Constitution&#x2014;and shows, as never before, how it was only with Washington's spirited behind-the-scenes influence that the delegates passed, and the states later ratified, the founding document that has guided our government to this day. </p><p>From the moment of General Washington's resignation to his victory in the first federal elections and his triumphant inauguration in New York as our first President, <em>The Return of George Washington</em> is a landmark work that will forever change our understanding and appreciation of America's great founder.</p><p>EDWARD J.

This remarkably pliant material was also the stuff of broad transformations in aesthetics, design, manufacturing, and marketing. Furnishings by the Viennese companies Gebruder Thonet and Jacob &amp; Josef Kohn tell the history of Modernism, from the Biedermeier era, Victorian eclecticism, the Secession and Art Nouveau to the 1930s International Style. Josef Hoffmann, Otto Wagner, and Adolf Loos were among the avant-garde architects who created designs in bentwood; Modernist visionaries like Le Corbusier celebrated early Thonet chairs for their purity of form. From the innovations of a German cabinetmaker to an international conglomerate with over ten thousand workers, the evolution of bentwood furniture encapsulates the industrial revolution itself.<br>Against the Grain: Bentwood Furniture from the Collection of Fern and Manfred Steinfeld documents The Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition of an important private collection, with essays by three notable scholars and a catalog section of seventy-five duotone reproductions. Art Institute curator Ghenete Zelleke outlines the stylistic transformations of bentwood furniture between the 1850s and the 1920s, discussing consumer taste in the development of furniture forms and the impact of historical shifts and aesthetic reform. Eva B. Ottillinger examines both the technical developments that led to industrialization and the marketing strategies that enabled mass consumption. Nina Stritzler discusses Thonet after 1922 as a leader in tubular-steel furniture by such architects as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and assesses the impact of industrial design and the corporate style on post-World War furniture.<br>Seventy-five excellent bentwood examples from the Steinfeld collection are illustrated in this catalog, with entries by Ghenete Zelleke.

Along the way, she explores such concepts as loyalty to one's family and country, the place of language in culture, and the roles of race, racism and ethnicity in how we perceive ourselves and others. In doing so, she has skillfully touched on questions at the very heart of politics, culture and global relations today.</p><p>Loh narrates the book through the eyes of Claude Lim -- a young man from a fine, upstanding Chinese family -- who is undergoing a brutal interrogation at the hands of the Japanese. Claude, with his perfect English and seemingly assured future at Oxford, can't believe what's happening. To be mistaken for someone Chinese -- "dirty," "crude" and "superstitious" -- is the worst insult he could endure, and yet here he is, undergoing torture for being the very thing he loathes. In an effort to protect what he might know, Claude takes a page from his grandmother's bible, General Sun Tzu's The Art of War: "All warfare is based on deception." As knives slash his face and he hears his friends being tortured in the next room, he unwittingly comes to realize that the Fifth Columnist who turned him in already knows -- "the truth has countless permutations." </p><p>So Claude looks back and tells his story -- at times shielding the ones he loves, at times exposing their worst secrets. His father, Humphrey, "infatuated by the idea of Empire," speaks English-accented English, works in an English bank, and forces his family to sit on the veranda every sweltering afternoon for English high tea, believing that if they become fully Anglicized then they will be accepted by the British as equals. Claude's mother, Cynthia, is so filled with self-loathing that she burns the inside of her wrists -- and those of the Englishmen to whom she is an "exotic" conquest -- with cigarettes. Sister Lucy, like Claude, is so distanced from who she is that she's been known to proclaim "I'm not Chinese!" This privileged family, with its belief in the merits of English rule, is in for a rude awakening.</p><p>Soon enough the family flees the capital for the safety of a farm in the countryside, leaving Claude behind to care for a sick friend, Jack Winchester -- a Brit who, until war broke out, moved surely through the thronging crowds, fully confident in his position. Claude is virtually useless in his attempts to care for Jack until he meets Ling-li, a Chinese nurse and sometime spy, who helps them both but in very different ways. If, lying limp, prostrate and indefinite in his illness, Jack is a symbol of the fall of the British Empire, then Ling-li, who is difficult, persistent and relentless in her ability to endure, is a symbol of Asia. Ling-li patronizes Claude for being immature and naive, and lets Jack know that he is just another burdensome white man and that Asia must be for Asians.</p><p>Even as Claude tells his interrogators of his time spent with Ling-li and Jack, the Fifth Columnist is simultaneously using many of the same facts to create a parallel tale of spying, intrigue and betrayal. Several real-life personages make appearances, including Patrick Heenan, a "mongrel" of East Indian and Irish descent, who realizes that his natal cultures have no use for him, and not only embraces the Japanese but finds that they return his affection; eventually he becomes the traitor who betrays British defense plans to his new friends. </p><p>Loh writes through shadows cast by Joseph Conrad, George Orwell, E.M. Forster and what can be assumed to be personal experience to add layer upon layer of texture -- the suffocating heat and humidity of the tropics, doses of curry and gin, native peoples astutely aware of the foolishness of the white men who rule over them, and the pettiness of those colonials who know that their lives are far better "out there" than back home living in a cold-water flat, working in a dead-end job, limited by class accent, unable to afford servants and chauffeurs. Loh sees it all through the polyglot culture that is Singapore, where English, Malay, Thai, Tamil, Tagalog, Hokkien, Cantonese, Hindi, Farsi, Nepalese and Hainanese create a cacophony of sound on the street. Loh understands that within that cacophony are individual voices, each with a unique point of view.</p><p>Putting aside obvious comparisons to recent activity in the Middle East and elsewhere, readers will find issues of a far more introspective nature. Singapore may have been one of the more diverse places in the world 60 years ago, but today the United States is arguably the most diverse place on the earth. How do we identify ourselves, and how do others identify us? Are we our face, our blood, our clothes, our language, our citizenship? These questions confront everyday people like the Harvard-educated doctor who's mistaken for a redneck because of his Southern accent or the Wall Street executive who can't get a taxi because he's African American, as well as folks like Michael Jackson, Eminem, John Walker Lindh and even Tiger Woods. In a novel about what happened on a small island in the midst of worldwide upheaval, Loh not only sees how individuals -- with all of their hopes and dreams, strengths and weaknesses -- move through history, but has also used them well to illuminate the present. </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Lisa See</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Her play "Angel," a drama about the trial and execution of a Nazi war criminal, was a winner of the Open Book/Fireside Theatre National Playwriting competition. It was produced in New York City and has enjoyed regional performances. </p><p>She organized Comboat! &#x2018;96, a Caribbean cruise that was the first reunion of the cast since the series had ended. Two years later, she again reunited cast and fans for Recon &#x2018;98 in the SimiValley, California, which included a tour of Franklin Canyon, where so many Combat! episodes were filmed. She is webmaster for the Combat! Fan Page, where fans have gathered for information and discussion since 1996.</p>INTRODUCTION by Jo Davidsmeyer <p>"We had a ball," says Tom Lowell, who played Billy Nelson for the first two seasons of Combat! "There are several things I've done in my career that I'm very proud of. But my remembrances of having worked in the business are focused toward one area only, and that's the two years that I spent on Combat! It was the best. Yes, I worked at Disney, at all sorts of other things, but this was the most fun time with these guys. I could not wait to get to work every day." </p><p>Tom Lowell's sentiment is shared by many fans of the show. Those, like myself, who were children when Combat! first aired in the sixties, couldn't wait for Tuesday night when we would sit before our television sets, hanging on every action of the men of King Company. Between Tuesdays, we recreated the battles in our backyards, terrorizing the neighborhood pets. The show appealed to a variety of ages, from young children to veterans of both world wars. Teens watched the show with parents who served in the war, using the series as a bridge between generations. Drill Sergeants watched Combat! with their men, using it for object lessons or to critique the military operations. </p><p>Something about this particular TV series resonated with its audience. Baby-boomers who re-discover Combat! as adults find that the show holds up well over the decades. They are surprised that it has a depth and meaning they had not perceived as children. Forty years after the cameras stopped, Combat! is still fresh and vital. The characters of Hanley, Saunders, and the rest of the squad continue to entertain and engage new audiences. </p><p>For the youngest fans of Combat!, World War II and Normandy sound as distant as Shiloh and Antietam did to the World War II generation. Still, Combat! attracts new fans around the wiorld, as it enjoys renewed life in syndication. It has a message still relevant to a world that has since entered into another millennium. </p><p>Many vieweres are drawn to Combat! by the special chemistry among the characters. Combat! rises above the typical action show because the stories are about people, not just explosions and hardware. The strong acting and superior scripts of the "human drama of men at war" are remarkably compelling. </p><p>I first saw Combat! when I was six years old. That started a love affair that's lasted a lifetime. In 1993, I began seeking others who remembered Combat! Then, I was thrilled just to discuss the show with others who remembered its haunting drama. I had little notion that my search would lead me to meet the actors, get to know them and their art well, and to be personally blessed by the loving friendship of both Dick Peabody and Rick Jason, who have since gone to their reward. </p><p>This is a revised version of the original book printed in 1997. The 2002 edition includes updates of cast and crew information. I've also added short reviews of all the epiisodes and an index. </p><p>This book expresses the admiration and affection I have for this show and the people who created it. I hope that readers will find this book useful as an armchair companion for viewing the episodes. I have no desire to be coldly objection about Combat! First and formost, I am a fan, happy to scout ahead and "take the point." </p><p>-- Jo Davidsmeyer</p></p><h2>Fortress 11: Crusader Castles of the Teutonic Knights (1) AD</h2><p>Throughout their stormy history the Teutonic Knights of Germany have always been the most controversial brotherhood ever to call themselves &#39;Knights of Christ&#39;.They were the most warlike of the religious orders, and this is reflected in the architecture they left behind. In contrast to the Templars who are remembered for their churches, the Teutonic memorials are the magnificent brick-built castles they built as a result of their conquest of Prussia between 1230 and 1380. Many of these dramatic fortresses still exist today in what is now Poland and provide a unique example of an architectural style that closely reflects the nature of the Order.</p><p>Stephen Turnbull is recognised as one of the world&#39;s foremost military historians of the medieval and early modern periods.

Includes a list of abbreviations, organizations, and terms. For general readers. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p><p><b>Kevin Toolis</b>, a journalist and screenwriter, was born in Edinburgh of Irish parents. <i>Rebel Hearts </i>is his first book.</p>Small societies with big troubles often spawn remarkable books, and this one on the IRA by Toolis, a British journalist of Irish descent, is one of the best. The unequal dimensions of the adversaries are extraordinary enough. The IRA consists of about 600 volunteers and has a budget of less that $8 million a year. By comparison, the British government has 30,000 combat troops in Northern Ireland and spends &#x153;1 billion a year in attempting to suppress its opponents. Since 1973 the war has been taken to England itself in an attempt ``to sap the will of the British Government.'' The IRA came close to assassinating Margaret Thatcher and a number of her colleagues in Brighton, and more recently John Major and his War Cabinet while they were meeting at Downing Street. The strength of Toolis's book is that he communicates the personal dimension of this dedication and cruelty: a once apolitical family whose sons became leaders in the IRA or lawyers defending it; Paddy Flood, who was executed by the IRA as a traitor; Frankie Ryan, who blew himself and his girlfriend up while trying to set off a bomb; Joe MacManus, who died trying to murder a Protestant dog-catcher; and Martin McGuinness, who is probably the head of the IRA. Toolis believes the ``the long horror of Ulster's troubles is dwindling away to a whimpering conclusion,'' an opinion surprising in light of the evidence of polarization that he deploys. Despite the ``final bitter contradiction'' that ``the justice of the political cause was invalidated by the cruelty of the murders carried out in its name,'' he believes that ``there will be peace in Ireland and it will be a republican peace.'' One can argue with his conclusions, but it would be hard to find another book that looks as dispassionately into the soul of the IRA and its influence on the future of Northern Ireland. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The mysterious Fermina love the girls as if they are her own, and promises to endow each with a "special gift" to be received upon her death. <br><br>Mindful of the old woman's mystical ways, the sisters believe Fermina's gifts, bestowed based on their natural talents, magically enhance their lives. The oldest sister, Bette Davis Gabald�n, always teased for telling tales, believes her gift is the power to persuade anyone, no matter how outlandish her story. Loretta Young, who often prefers pets to people, assumes her gift is the ability to heal animals. Tough-talking tomboy, Rita Hayworth believes her gift is the ability to curse her enemies. And finally, Sophia Loren, the baby of the family, is sure her ability to make people laugh is her legacy. <br><br>As the four girls grow into women they discover that Fermina's gifts come with complicated strings, and what once seemed simple can confuse over time. Together they learn the truth about their mysterious caretaker, her legacy, and the family secret that was nearly lost forever in the New Mexican desert.</p><p>Lorraine L�pez is an Assistant Professor of English in the Creative Writing Program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

However, their mother died young, so rather than be raised to emulate movie stars, they were raised by Fermina, their elderly Pueblo housekeeper, with mysterious mystical rituals, promises, curses, and gifts. The sisters tell their stories in turn over a period of 20 years, from 1966 to 1987; their narrations are interspersed with Works Progress Administration reports from the 1930s about Fermina. As the girls grow up, they wonder more and more about their family's and Fermina's mysterious unhappy pasts and about Fermina's dying gifts. Occasionally reminiscent of the novels of Cristina Garcia and Sandra Cisneros, López's book presents a lively, loving Latino family.

Jacob Miller is an angry, bitter city child who associates his family's poverty with being black. Despite Jacob's pessimistic attitude, his younger brother Peewee persuades him to help build a snowman, even though the snow is black from city dirt and traffic. "A black snowman," says Jacob, with his usual sarcasm. "Just what I always wanted." Picking through trashcans to find a wardrobe for the snowman, Peewee comes across a colorful rag which he drapes around their new creation. It turns out to be a magical kente cloth from West Africa which has the power to restore memory, and it brings the snowman to life. Through a dreamlike sequence later that night, the snowman transforms bricks and trashcan lids into majestic African warriors and queens. He tells Jacob stories of his ancient African ancestors, thereby instilling in the boy a sense of self-respect and pride in his heritage. Mendez' message for the current generation of black youth is clear: be proud of yourself and your African ancestry. Due to the length and complexity of the story, The Black Snowman is suitable for a slightly older audience than is typical for the picture-book format. A large, clear typeface makes it accessible to newly independent readers, while Byard's large, bold illustrations make it a candidate for reading aloud to the same age group. And Byard's illustrations are not to be missed. In mood and content, they most closely resemble her work for Eloise Greenfield's Africa Dream (Crowell, 1977), although here her use of color gives added emotional depth and power to her work. While the art style is realistic, the soft, rounded shapes express the homey security of Jacob's family. A wide range of luminous blue, gray, brown and purple hues enriches the textured beauty of the illustrations. The artist's focus on a glowing darker spectrum in the dramatic nighttime sequences subtly reinforces the snowman's message to Jacob that there is dark beauty all around him, if he would only look for it. --Kathleen T. Horning, Madison Pub . Lib .#<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Jacob Miller is an inner-city boy who hates being black and poor. He reluctantly assists his little brother Peewee in making a black snowman from the filthy snow in the back alley. The figure comes alive after they unknowingly drape him in a fragment of the magical kente , a cloth worn by African storytellers for hundreds of years. The snowman challenges Jacob's outlook on life by telling him all the wonderful things that are black, and mysteriously conjuring forth brave heroes from African tribal tradition. When Peewee is trapped inside a burning building, the snowman shows Jacob a way to save his brother while exhorting the boy to believe in himself. Using mystical elements and the power of the past, Mendez, in his first book, weaves a stirring tale of Jacob's transformation from a bitter victim of his situation into a proud fighter for his life. Byard's haunting color drawings bring to life not only the snowman; they successfully portray the many contrasts between Jacob's dour moods, Peewee's optimism, the dingy apartment and the eerie parade of stately African tribesmen. The valuable lesson inherent in The Black Snowman is not just for black children but for all who struggle for identity within their own worlds.

When you meet a man from that town you feel a kind of brotherhood with him, till the talk runs down and you can&#x2019;t remember any more names.<br><br> The city started sooner than I expected it to. In ten years it had crawled out along the highway, covering new farms with the concrete squares of suburban developments. On both sides of the highway I could see the rows of little frame houses, all alike, as if there were only one architect in the city and he had a magnificent obsession.<br><br> &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be long now,&#x201d; the transport driver said. He yawned over the wheel, keeping his eyes on the road. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need any dago red to put me to sleep tonight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You live here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I got a room in a boardinghouse at this end. You could call it living, I guess.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you like the town?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right if you don&#x2019;t know any better places.&#x201d; He spat through his open window into the current of air that the truck&#x2019;s movement made, and a fine spray blew across the back of my neck. &#x201c;I call Chicago home. That&#x2019;s where my wife is.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That makes the difference.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You married?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m traveling on my own.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Looking for a job, eh?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have any trouble here. Matter of fact, we need helpers down at the depot right now. Half the time I have to load my own truck. You strong enough?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m strong enough. But that&#x2019;s not the kind of a job I was thinking about.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pretty good pay. Seventy cents an hour. You can&#x2019;t do better than that around here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe I can. I&#x2019;ve got connections.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You have?&#x201d; He gave me a quick look. I wasn&#x2019;t looking so good. I hadn&#x2019;t shaved or washed that day, and my clothes had been slept in.<br><br> He must have decided I was lying. He said with broad irony: &#x201c;Oh well, in that case,&#x201d; and stopped talking to me.<br><br> The highway had changed into the east end of the main street, half residential and half business. Neighborhood grocery stores, coal yards, gas stations, cheap taverns, big old rundown houses, a few churches with blank embarrassed faces. I couldn&#x2019;t remember the buildings ahead of time, but nearly everything was familiar once I saw it. I caught a whiff of the rubber factories on the south side, corrupting the spring night like an armpit odor. I watched the suppertime crowds on the street, looking for someone I might remember.<br><br> The driver applied the brakes, and the truck came to a stop at the curb.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you out here, bud. I can&#x2019;t take you down to the depot.&#x201d; He nodded toward the &#x201c;No Riders&#x201d; sticker on the windshield. &#x201c;But in case your connections don&#x2019;t pan out, you want to come down there. It&#x2019;s on Masters Street.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks. And thanks for the ride.&#x201d;<br><br> I hoisted my canvas suitcase from under my feet and climbed down out of the cabin. The big truck moved away and left me standing on the curb.<br><br> I walked a couple of blocks in the direction the truck had taken, but I was in no hurry to go anywhere. The excitement I had felt on coming back to the city had worn off already. Men and women passed me going both ways, but they were nobody I knew. A policeman gave me a sharp glance. I realized that I must look like a bum, and the realization made me feel like one. I began to wonder for the first time that day if my connections in the town were worth anything. Perhaps they didn&#x2019;t even exist any more.<br><br> I passed a new apartment building whose windows were like holes in a box of light. Through one of them I caught a glimpse of a man and woman dancing to the radio, holding each other close. It was enough to bring back the feeling of loneliness that I had been having off and on for years. I wanted to know every room in every apartment in that building I had never seen before, and call everyone who lived there by his first name. At the same time I wished I had the power to destroy the building and everybody in it.<br><br> I hadn&#x2019;t had a fight for a long time, and I was spoiling for one.<br><br> Across the street a neon sign said: &#x201c;Schlitz Beer on Draught,&#x201d; and I crossed to it. The plate-glass window of the tavern was half-curtained, but I could see over the curtain. It was a big square room full of wooden chairs and tables, with a bar at the back. In the cold yellow light of the fly-specked ceiling lamps, I could see that the tables were scarred by carved initials and the charred grooves left by untended cigarettes. The place was almost empty, and the few people that were there didn&#x2019;t look as if they&#x2019;d make me feel out of place.<br><br> I went inside and sat on a stool at the bar. The bartender paid no attention to me. He was busy being a character for the benefit of a couple of other customers, a peroxide blonde and a henna redhead at the other end of the bar. The girls were sitting one on each side of a big young man in a topcoat made of imitation llama.<br><br> &#x201c;So you want another drink,&#x201d; the bartender said with a wide cruel smile. &#x201c;You think I got nothing better to do than give you another drink. Don&#x2019;t you know by this time of night all I can think about is my feet? My feet are killing me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that a promise?&#x201d; the peroxide blonde said in a shrill, peroxide-blonde voice. The women giggled, and the man between them hugged them, one under each arm.<br><br> &#x201c;The way you talk,&#x201d; the bartender said, &#x201c;the way you talk, you&#x2019;d think I get paid money to stand here and feed you characters whisky&#x2014;when all the time my feet are killing me.&#x201d;<br><br> He was gray-headed and massive. His belly hung out over his belt and swayed like a huge bosom when he moved.<br><br> &#x201c;You should try reducing, Henry,&#x201d; the blonde said. &#x201c;Take some of that weight off your feet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; the bartender said. &#x201c;You asked for it and you&#x2019;ll get it. But I warn you this bar whisky is the lousiest stuff this side of the sewer farm.&#x201d; He poured three shots out of an unlabeled bottle and set them on the bar.<br><br> &#x201c;You should know, Henry,&#x201d; the blonde said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s milk to me,&#x201d; Henry said.<br><br> I rapped on the bar with a quarter.<br><br> &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s getting impatient,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;When somebody gets impatient that makes me nervous. When I get nervous I&#x2019;m no damn good for anything at all.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A bottle of beer,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;Look at my hand,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s trembling like a leaf.&#x201d; He held out a big gray hand and smiled down at it. &#x201c;Beer, you say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If this place is still in business.&#x201d;<br><br> He took a bottle out of the cooler, uncapped it, and shuffled along the bar towards me.<br> He looked at me with potential dislike. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, you got no sense of humor?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure, but I checked it in another town. Go right on being sidesplitting for your friends.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a stranger in town, aren&#x2019;t you? Maybe you just don&#x2019;t know how we talk around here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m learning fast.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t learn too fast.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you serve glasses with your beer? I&#x2019;ll have one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Olive or maraschino?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just dip your thumb in it when you pour it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pour it yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> I picked up my bottle and glass and sat down at a table against the wall. An old man with a glass of beer in front of him was facing me at the next table. There was a shag of beard on his face, shading from pure white on his cheeks and upper lip to iron gray on his flabby neck. When I had poured my beer and raised my glass to my lips, he raised his glass and winked at me.<br><br> I smiled back before I drank, and regretted it a minute later when he got up and moved towards my table. A shapeless brown overcoat hung about his body, and he walked like a sack of rags. He slumped into the other chair, rested his moth-eaten arms on the table, and leaned towards me with a sweet, dirty smile, which showed no teeth. He smelled of beer and age.<br><br> &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t used to be like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But after all, life begins at sixty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you sixty-five?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;�Sixty-six. Yeah, I know I look older, but those strokes I had take it out of a man. The first one gave me a hell of a jolt, but it didn&#x2019;t hurt me any except that it slowed me down. But the second one was a dandy. I still can&#x2019;t use my left hand, probably never will be able to again.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got funny reasons for saying that life begins at sixty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sweet C�sar, those aren&#x2019;t my reasons! It&#x2019;s for different reasons entirely that my life began at sixty-five. That was when I qualified.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Qualified for what? Voting?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Qualified for the old-age pension, son. Ever since then I&#x2019;ve been my own boss. No more getting pushed around, no more licking asses, not for me! Nobody can take that pension away from me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great thing,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wonderful thing. It&#x2019;s the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me in my life.&#x201d;<br><br> He finished his beer and I ordered him another.<br><br> &#x201c;Who was your boss before you got the pension?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can you imagine what they did to me?&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;And that was when I couldn&#x2019;t walk yet after my second stroke. They put me out in the county poorhouse, with nobody to look after me except my chums out there. They said all the hospitals were full. I still have some of the bedsores I got then. And then they weren&#x2019;t going to give me my old-age pension, even after I qualified.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What was the matter?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You see, son, I couldn&#x2019;t prove my age. You&#x2019;d think if they took one look at me they could see how old I am, but that wasn&#x2019;t good enough. I was born on a farm and my daddy never registered my birth, so I couldn&#x2019;t get a birth certificate. I would&#x2019;ve been up the creek without a paddle, if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Mr. Allister. He got my case investigated and people to swear to me, and everything turned out jake. Now I got me a little place of my own under the stairs at the warehouse, and nobody can say boo to me.&#x201d;<br><br> Two men came in and sat down at a table near us. One was short and broad. He wore a limp cloth cap and a decayed leather windbreaker. The other was tall and very thin, his face a vague triangle with the apex pointed down. He took a mouth organ out of the pocket of his shiny blue suit coat and blew a few dreamy notes. His companion drummed on the table with cracked dirty knuckles and looked stonily ahead.<br><br> &#x201c;Who is this Allister?&#x201d; I asked the old man.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know who Mr. Allister is? You haven&#x2019;t been around here long, have you? Mr. Allister is the Mayor of this town.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And he helped you with your pension? He must be a pretty good egg.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mr. Allister is the finest man in this town.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Things have changed around here,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It used to be that J.D.

Excuse me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait a minute. How did he get killed?&#x201d; I put my hand on his arm, which felt like a bone wrapped in rags.<br><br> &#x201c;He just plain got killed,&#x201d; the old man said impatiently. &#x201c;Somebody shot him and he died.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake! Who shot him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You got to let me go, son. I been drinking beer.&#x201d;<br><br> I let go of his arm and he shuffled away to the men&#x2019;s room. The blonde and the redhead and their joint property in imitation llama had drifted away to other bars. The short man and the tall man finished their draught beers and wandered into the men&#x2019;s room. Now the room was deserted except for the bartender, who was wiping glasses and paying no attention to me. The ugly, empty room was one of a long series of lonely bars in towns I didn&#x2019;t know. If J.D. Weather was dead, this town was going to be as lonely as the rest.<br><br> There was a low growl of men&#x2019;s voices from the lavatory. I couldn&#x2019;t make out any words but there was unpleasantness in the sound, which was emphasized a minute later by a muffled thud. I glanced at the bartender, but he was busy with his glasses.<br><br> Then somebody sobbed in the men&#x2019;s room. I got up and walked through the door. The old man was sitting on the dirty tile floor with his back to the wall. A bead of blood had fallen from one of his nostrils onto his white mustache. The tall mouth organist and his companion stood in the center of the small room, watching me. The old man&#x2019;s hat was on the floor near their feet.<br> <br>The old man was crying. &#x201c;They took my money,&#x201d; he sobbed. &#x201c;Make them give me back my money.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t got his money,&#x201d; the short man said. &#x201c;He called me a dirty name, so I gave him a slap.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The lousy, bullying bastards!&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;They took my sixteen dollars.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You shut up,&#x201d; said the tall man, taking a step towards him.<br><br> &#x201c;Leave him alone,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And give him back his money.&#x201d;<br><br> The tall man stayed where he was.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah?&#x201d; the short man said. His eyes were bright blue, as hard and glistening as glass eyes. &#x201c;You and who else is going to make me?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting tired waiting,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Give him back his money.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have no money,&#x201d; the short man said. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Swainie, let&#x2019;s get the hell out of here.&#x201d;<br><br> I braced my heel on the doorjamb and swung as I moved into him. He ducked his jaw quickly, but my fist caught the bridge of his nose. He moved in on me and clinched me around the waist with his round head under my right arm.</p><h2>The Dark Side: Thoughts on the Futility of Life from the Ancient Greeks to the Present</h2><p>Briefly traces the history of nihilism, offers a chronological selection of quotes describing the meaninglessness of life, and includes brief profiles of the darkest thinkers</p><p></p><h2>Prague: The Mystical City</h2><p>Hardback book with dust jacket titled PRAGUE: The Mystical City by Joseph Wechsberg.

As far as porcelain was concerned, until the last 20 years, it was a little-known reign not only in the West but in China itself. <p>By the late 1630s, painters on porcelain had developed a new, highly recognizable, and successful style. Many of the innovative themes were taken from woodblock prints, with landscapes and narrative scenes particularly inspired by contemporary scroll and album paintings. Soon after 1644, potters began to paint wonderful landscapes, with stylistic devices such as clouds and rock formations used to fill in the "back" of the pot. The beauty and liveliness of the pots' paintings, along with the evolving shapes of the pots, stands out and makes these years a most significant period the art history of China. In the Shunzhi era, more than any other time in the last 500 years of Chinese porcelain, there was a strong emphasis on individual works of art, each one unique.</p></p><p>ART</p><h2>The Political Writings of John Adams</h2><p>This book is the most comprehensive single volume of John Adam's political writings ever published.

In the author&#39;s words, &#34;The emergence of legitimate party opposition and of a theory of politics that accepted it was something new in the history of the world; it required a bold new act of understanding on the part of its contemporaries and it still requires study on our part.&#34; Professor Hofstadter&#39;s analysis of the idea of party and the development of legitimate opposition offers fresh insights into the political crisis of 1797-1801, on the thought of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Martin Van Buren, and other leading figures, and on the beginnings of modern democratic politics.</p><p>The late <b>Richard Hofstadter</b> was DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University.

Taking on the likes of Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, Lillian Hellman, and Noam Chomsky in turn, Johnson examines one idol after another and finds them all to have feet of clay. In his account, for instance, Ernest Hemingway emerges as an artistic hero who labored endlessly to forge a literary style unmistakably his own, but also as a deeply flawed man whose concern for the perfect phrase did not carry over to a concern for the women who loved him. Gossipy and sharply opinionated, Johnson's essay in cultural history spares no one.<p> Does it really matter that Henrik Ibsen was vain and arrogant, that Jean-Paul Sartre was incontinent? In Johnson's view, it does: these all-too-human foibles disqualify them, and other thinkers, from presuming to criticize the shortcomings of society. "Beware intellectuals," he concludes (though, given the subjects of his book, it seems he means intellectuals only of the left). "Not only should they be kept well away from the levers of power, they should also be objects of particular suspicion when they seek to offer collective advice." Whether one agrees or not, Johnson's profiles are frequently amusing and illuminating, as when he suggests that the only proletarian Karl Marx ever knew in person was the poor maid who worked for him for decades and was never paid, except in room and board, for her labors. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Paul Johnson was born in 1928.

Devotional, even celebratory in their cadence, they move with the gravity of high art.</p><p>Linda Gregerson writes with a quiet power and a subtle musicality about perseverance, suffering, grace, and hope in the face of disease and mortality. Mark Strand calls her work &#34;among the very best being written.&#34; In &#34;The Resurrection of the Body,&#34; Gregerson paints a scene of love and determination at her child&#39;s physical therapy clinic. As one mother wipes drool from her daughter&#39;s mouth, Gregerson writes: &#34;The mother would give her soul to see / this child lift her head on her own.&#34; These poems conjure such relationships with a balance of the graceful and the elemental.This second book of poems by a powerful, compassionate, and fiercely intelligent poet bravely explores the ways in which we humans encounter mortality: the assaults of disease and bodily harm, the cruel inequities of material and psychic well-being, domestic treachery, self-slaughter, failures of mind. Linda Gregerson&#39;s work emphasizes the resourcefulness of the human spirit, the intelligence of the body, the abundant beauty of the created world. What readers will love about these poems - many of them centered on young children - is the way they combine straightforwardness and complexity. Gregerson is not an ordinary believer, but the rhythms and icons of faith pervade her work. Readers will also relish the music of these poems and the remarkable use of line breaks and patterns on the page, which give her poems aesthetic as well as moral authority. These are not light verses, far from it, but they are unashamedly poems of praise. Devotional, even celebratory in their cadence, they move with the gravity of high art.</p><h2>A Man Lies Dreaming</h2><p>Man Lies Dreaming</p><p><p>Lavie Tidhar is the World Fantasy Award winning author of THE VIOLENT CENTURY,<i>Osama</i>, of<i>The Bookman Histories</i>trilogy and many other works.

Suzuki is based upon the Sanskrit edition of Bunyu Nanjo (1923). This edition reflects those fundamental themes of Buddhism which the Mahayana in general cherishes and upholds. It looks at existence from the absolute and relative realms, and thinks that suffering will be experienced so long as one confines oneself to the realm of the relative. Since the relative cannot be ultimately realm, it has to be seen as nothing more than a projection of the mind. As to how to realize the ultimate truth of unity the text resorts to general Mahayana theory of Buddhalogy in which the Buddha is seen as the ultimate ontological principle. <p>In order to realize unity with this ontic principle, we have to make use of such methods which, though relative, terminate in the realization of Enlightenment. These methods are spoken of as Skilful Means. As a spiritual manual, the text points out as to how the Bodhisattvas, on account of their unlimited compassion for sentient beings, work for the salvation of all. While delineating on the theme of Bodhisattvas, the text thereby speaks about the ten vows of a Bodhisattva. It is in incarnating these vows within that a real turn-about or spiritual transformation occurs, and thereby are uprooted the roots of ignorance. The text, thus, offers a spiritual banquet to those who want to taste the bliss eternal.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Warlord of Antares (Dray Prescot #37)</h2><p>The final conflict!

For George Bush, being Commander in Chief during Desert Storm was not enough. Domestic issues, personality factors, and the vagaries of the 1992 campaign confined his presidency to a single term. John Robert Greene helps us understand why. <br><br>This first comprehensive history of George Bush's administration paints a striking portrait of a "positive moderate" whose accomplishments are often underrated. Greene's is the first book to make use of the entire range of literature on the forty-first president&#x2014;including the Bush Papers at the George Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&amp;M University&#x2014;and draws on key interviews with members of his administration and with George Bush himself. <br><br>Greene sets Bush's presidency in the context of the Reagan years and reviews not only his foreign policy successes&#x2014;notably the war with Iraq and an improved relationship with Russia&#x2014;but also key domestic issues: economic recession, the much maligned "Read My Lips" tax hike, Clarence Thomas's controversial Supreme Court appointment, and the enactment of bills that protected the environment and improved the lives of disabled Americans. Greene also offers an insightful analysis of Bush's bid for reelection, describing a campaign that saw conservatives abandoning Bush in droves while early signs of an economic upturn did little to defuse the Democrats' advantage.<br><br>Greene is particularly insightful on Bush the person, depicting the president as a man of patience and prudence who placed great value on loyalty and who was better at managing crises than he was the day-to-day demands of the presidency. He shows us the sense of humor and love of the outdoors in a man often branded an elitist or a wimp, who ultimately was never able to manipulate his public image to his advantage.<br><br><i>The Presidency of George Bush</i> takes into account the many facets of the Bush administration, from the spirited optimism of a thousand points of light to the unsettling vagueness of "the vision thing," and shows us a man whose careful stewardship set the tone for post-Cold War foreign policy. As Greene notes, while Bush had his critics, it was on his watch that the Cold War ended and America reasserted its military might.</p><p>"A concise and readable account of the Bush presidency based on a mastery of the secondary literature, judicious interviews with the participants, and citations from the Bush presidential library. Greene offers a balanced and quite convincing picture of Bush's policies at home and abroad. His portrait of Bush as a person and treatment of Bush's foreign policy are particularly well done."--Robert Divine, author of <i>Eisenhower and the Cold War</i> and <i>Eisenhower and Sputnik</i>John Robert Greene is professor of history and communications at Cazenovia College and author of <i>The Presidency of Gerald R. Ford</i></p><h2>The Lighthouse Road: A Novel</h2><p>Against the wilds of sea and wood, a young immigrant woman settles into life outside Duluth in the 1890s, still shocked at finding herself alone in a new country, abandoned and adrift; in the early 1920s, her orphan son, now grown, falls in love with the one woman he shouldn&#x2019;t and uses his best skills to build them their own small ark to escape. But their pasts travel with them, threatening to capsize even their fragile hope. In this triumphant new novel, Peter Geye has crafted another deeply moving tale of a misbegotten family shaped by the rough landscape in which they live--often at the mercy of wildlife and weather--and by the rough edges of their own breaking hearts.</p><p><b>Peter Geye</b> received his M.F.A. from the University of New Orleans and his Ph.D. from Western Michigan University, where he was editor of <i>Third Coast.</i> Also the author of the award-winning novel, <i>Safe from the Sea,</i> he lives in Minnesota.<br>"Peter Geye writes with the mesmerizing power of the snowstorms that so often come howling off Lake Superior. I am in awe of how he swirls through so many years and juggles so many characters, all of them unforgettable and weighed down by secrets and regrets and desires that burn through the hoarfrost of Geye's bristling sentences." Benjamin Percy<br><br>Geye (Safe from the Sea) returns to his familiar setting, the unforgiving landscape of northern Minnesota, and brings the plight of Norwegian immigrants vividly to life. On a cold November in 1896, a son is born to Thea Eide, a cook in a primitive logging camp. She succumbs to fever, and the boy, named Odd, is left in the care of his guardian, Hosea Grimm. Grimm delivers babies, sets broken bones, and runs an apothecary in the town of Gunflint. As a young man, Odd despairs of ever getting away from Hosea and his other enterprises, bootlegging and prostitution, but he develops a plan: build and outfit his boat so he can escape with Grimm&#x2019;s daughter, Rebekah. When Rebekah announces she&#x2019;s expecting their baby, Odd accelerates their plans to leave for Duluth just as winter is setting in. He is able to provide for his new family as a boat builder, but there are no happy endings here, only resilience and resolve to carry on. Odd is determined that his son will not experience a loss as he did. VERDICT With spare realism, Geye puts a fresh spin on a familiar tale, rendering a powerful portrayal of family bonds in an era long past. Highly recommended. Library Journal<br><br> In his second novel, Geye brings the wilderness of northern Minnesota in a lumberjack camp and a small town and aboard a skiff riding the waves of Lake Superior to crackling, thundering life. Handled less skillfully, Geye's emphasis on one primary trait in his characters their intense longing for somewhere to belong and, at the same time, somewhere to be free might come off as one-dimensional, but here the story and its people achieve remarkable emotional resonance. The echoes of the characters' heartbreak through the generations are as haunting as the howling of the wolves on the wind.&#x201d; Booklist, starred review</p><h2>Maisy Goes Shopping</h2><p><b>More for Maisy fans!</b><br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Maisy Goes Shopping</i>, Charley and our favorite mouse make a trip to the grocery store to buy lots of goodies for lunch.

The Hollywood image of Dean Martin with a martini in one hand and a woman in the other continues to dominate public perception. Now, Dean's son Ricci reveals the husband and father few people knew, a man who hated parties, adored his mother-in-law, and found utter contentment in a slice of buttered bread.<br>In <i>That's Amore: A Son Remembers Dean Martin</i>, Ricci Martin takes readers on a tour through his childhood, from the star-studded parties to the exploration of "three marriages, eight kids, one family," to the treasured one-on-one time he shared with his father. He also discusses Dean's first meeting with Jerry Lewis and divulges his father's version of the Martin and Lewis breakup. Ricci Martin addresses the key relationships in his father's life, allowing readers to view the Rat Pack years, "The Dean Martin Show," and Dean's divorce from Jeanne through a son's eyes.<br><i>That's Amore</i> reveals the triumphs, tragedies, and escapades that colored Ricci's childhood, including his brother Dean Paul's death.

This scattershot memoir by Dean Martin's youngest son proves that sometimes the image on the screen is a lot more colorful than the father who comes home and enjoys a slice of bread before dinner. Martin's affectionate, innocuous and slightly dull book of memories will be a treat only for true Dino fans, affording them an intimate look at the performer at home. The anecdotes have an "I guess you had to be there" flavor ("One of Dad's favorite jokes, which he would pull when we went out to dinner, was to be having a conversation and absent-mindedly butter his big hands as if they were pieces of bread") that should appeal to those who enjoy the humor in Reader's Digest. The younger Martin's focus is strictly Dino-as-Dad, with very few peeks into his father's work on screen or in the recording studio. Life at 601 Mountain Drive was pretty idyllic, with parents who didn't mind their kids shooting guns inside the house and who were blas&#x201a; when older son Dean Paul bought a tank. The latter part of the book is sparked to life by a too-close-for-comfort association with Charles Manson and the tragic fatal plane crash of Dean Paul, which precipitated Dino's health deterioration.

That said, it's not like any other novel about the Irish that I've read. The story of the Hegartys is indeed bleak, and hard, but it surges with tenderness and eloquent thought which, in the end, are the very things that help this family (or at least her narrator Veronica) survive. Through her eyes, and in Enright's skillful imagination, those small turning-point moments of life that we all know in some form or another--a petty fight, a careless word, an event witnessed--come together in an unshakeable vision of how you become the person you are.<i> --Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br>Anne Enright was born in Dublin, where she now lives and works.

The genius of this biography is that it delves behind this image to reveal a life in which loss and heartache existed alongside rebellion and fierce ambition. Harman seizes on a crucial moment in the 1840s when Charlotte worked at a girls' school in Brussels and fell hopelessly in love with the husband of the school's headmistress. Her torment spawned her first attempts at writing for publication, and he haunts the pages of every one of her novels--he is Rochester in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Paul Emanuel in <i>Villette</i>. Another unrequited love--for her publisher--paved the way for Charlotte to enter a marriage that ultimately made her happier than she ever imagined. Drawing on correspondence unavailable to previous biographers, Claire Harman establishes Bront� as the heroine of her own story, one as dramatic and triumphant as one of her own novels.</p><p>CLAIRE HARMAN is the author of <i>Sylvia Townsend Warner,</i> winner of the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize; <i>Fanny Burney</i>;<i> Myself and the Other Fellow: A Life of Robert Louis Stevenson</i>; and <i>Jane's Fame: How Jane Austen Conquered the World</i>. She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and has taught at the Universities of Oxford and Manchester in England and Columbia University in New York. The author lives in Brooklyn, NY and Cambridge, England.Prologue<br><br> 1 September 1843<br><br> It is 1 September 1843 and a 27-year-old Englishwoman is alone at the Pensionnat Heger in Brussels, a girls&#x2019; school where she is an unpaid student-teacher. It is halfway through the long vacation and everyone else who has a home or family to go to left weeks ago: the proprietress, Madame Heger, is at the seaside with her husband and children; the other teachers are on holiday or travelling.<br><br> Miss Bront�&#x2019;s home is too far away to warrant a return for a mere two months. She can&#x2019;t afford the cost of the journey back to her father&#x2019;s Yorkshire parsonage, and, besides, arrangements should be kept to: Charlotte is a scrupulously dutiful person. But she is finding the empty dormitory oppressive, with all the beds covered in white cloths like a morgue; every meal is eaten alone, and the Pensionnat&#x2019;s beautiful garden, with its old fruit trees and <i>all�e d�fendue</i> of limes, seems more of a prison than a refuge when the rest of the school is abandoned. To escape the heavy solitude, it is Miss Bront�&#x2019;s habit to go out and walk the city and the surrounding countryside for hours at a time. &#x201c;I should inevitably fall into the gulf of low spirits if I stayed always by myself here without a human being to speak to,&#x201d; she writes to her sister Emily, who was her companion at the school the previous year and knows the place well. The truth is, although she doesn&#x2019;t tell Emily this, she is already in that gulf. She is desperately unhappy.<br><br> Her return to Brussels for a second year at the Pensionnat Heger Charlotte sees with hindsight to have been a terrible mistake, for she has fallen in love with someone who, it is painfully clear, will never see her in a romantic light. It is the headmistress&#x2019;s husband, Monsieur Constantin Heger, a man of impressive intellect and spirit, the first person outside her immediate family to take her seriously, the first man to treat her as a potential equal. But the thrill of having his attention in her first year, as a pupil, has been followed by misery in the second, as his junior colleague. The Hegers have become wary of Charlotte&#x2019;s ardour and eccentricities, and much more formal in their dealings with her. And now the man she considered her soul-mate is pretending that she is nothing special to him at all.<br><br> She looks in the mirror and sees, with ruthless clarity, a catalogue of defects; a huge brow, sallow complexion, prominent nose and a mouth that twists up slightly to the right, hiding missing and decayed teeth. She looks poor and ill-dressed, haunted and miserable, with none of the brilliant light from her &#x201c;great honest eyes&#x201d; that other people sometimes saw, and marvelled at. &#x201c;[I]t is an imbecility which I reject with contempt&#x2014;for women who have neither fortune nor beauty . . . not to be able to convince themselves that they are unattractive.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what she had written six months earlier, when her friend Ellen, back home in Yorkshire, had ventured to suggest that there was some romantic motive for Charlotte&#x2019;s return abroad.<br><br> The pain of staying indoors is too much: she sets off along the length of the parc Royal to the porte de Louvain, through the gate and up the long hill heading eastwards away from the city. &#x201c;No inhabitant of Brussels need wander far to search for solitude,&#x201d; she wrote later; &#x201c;let him but move half a league from his own city and he will find her brooding still and blank over the wide fields, so drear though so fertile, spread out treeless and trackless round the capital of Brabant.&#x201d; Her destination is the Protestant Cemetery in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, two miles beyond the walls of this predominantly Catholic city, a walk down into the hamlet of Evere, then up to the crest of a hill beyond. There is no church here, just a few dozen graves in a walled garden, heavily overgrown with cypress and yew, with inscriptions in English, French and German: the foreign tongues of alienated people dying far from home.<br><br> Charlotte has come to visit a particular grave, that of Martha Taylor, one of the West Riding family who had encouraged her to come out to Brussels in the first place and whose elder sister Mary had been Charlotte&#x2019;s most admired friend since girlhood. Charming, quirky Martha&#x2014;a flirt and chatterbox&#x2014;had been swept away by cholera: the last time Charlotte had been out to visit her grave was just two weeks after the funeral the previous October. Emily had been with her then, and Mary, and all three young women had gone back and spent a strange evening at the lodgings of another English family, the Dixons, in the rue Royale. But even that gloomy day seemed better than this utterly solitary one. The Dixons had all left Brussels now, as had Mary Taylor, and Emily was back home in Haworth.<br><br> From the cemetery Charlotte keeps walking away from the city, through valleys, farms and hamlets, to a hill where there is nothing but treeless fields as far as the eye can see. The furthest reach. She has to turn back, but coming into the city in the fading light she finds herself so desperately trying to put off returning to the Pensionnat that she ends up weaving around the surrounding streets to avoid it.<br><br> This unassuming-looking woman, tiny, unfashionable, darting out a look but not liking to hold one&#x2019;s eye, was <i>in extremis</i>.<br><br> Passing by the towering west front of the city&#x2019;s great cathedral, SS-Michel-et-Gudule, and hearing the bell calling the faithful to the evening service, Charlotte Bront� did something strange, unpredictable and entirely uncharacteristic: she followed the worshippers in. The prejudices that she had to overcome even to step inside the door of a Roman Catholic church were considerable; Charlotte, the daughter of an Irish Protestant minister, was, like all her family, ferociously anti-papist. She had been brought up to pity Catholics and to fear them&#x2014;one of her great sources of discomfort in Belgium was the mere fact of being in a Catholic country, surrounded by a &#x201c;Romanism&#x201d; that &#x201c;pervaded every arrangement.&#x201d; Her letters from Brussels are full of remarks about the superstitious nature of her Catholic pupils and colleagues, their &#x201c;sensual indulgence&#x201d; and the childishness of minds &#x201c;reared in slavery.&#x201d; But, on that lonely September evening, she found herself wandering up and down the aisles of the venerable Gothic church and staying to hear the service. When it was over, she was still reluctant to leave and, gravitating towards a part of the cathedral where six or seven people were kneeling, she let herself be directed into a confessional. Explaining this queer whim to her sister the next day, she said, &#x201c;I felt as if I did not care what I did, provided it was not absolutely wrong, and that it served to vary my life and yield a moment&#x2019;s interest. I took a fancy to change myself into a Catholic and go and make a real confession to see what it was like.&#x201d;<br><br> The ornate confessionals of Ste-Gudule are still there, guarded by massive wooden angels, with a central box for the priest and kneelers for penitents on either side. Charlotte had to wait at the grating for ten minutes while another confession proceeded in a barely audible whisper just a few feet away. It was a long interval for second and third thoughts to take hold, for the voice of her bigoted upbringing to shout down this strange &#x201c;fancy&#x201d;&#x2014;but she stayed put and eventually heard the communicating grille open and in the half-light saw the priest leaning her way&#x2014;her cue to begin.<br><br> What did she say? In the letter she wrote about the episode to Emily the next day, Charlotte described everything but the substance of her confession: she described the difficulty she had explaining to the priest (in French, of course) what she, a Protestant, was doing in his church at all; she described the priest&#x2019;s surprise and alarm, and the news that her religion precluded her from enjoying &#x201c;le bonheur du sacrement.&#x201d; &#x201c;[B]ut I was determined to confess,&#x201d; Charlotte said, and the priest eventually agreed to hear her, reasoning that it might be the first step towards a conversion. Freed by this act of kindness, &#x201c;I actually did confess&#x2014;a real confession.&#x201d; Her sense of relief is palpable.<br><br> The object of Charlotte&#x2019;s unrequited love, Constantin Heger, was a difficult, mercurial character who haunted each of her later novels (as Rochester in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Louis Moore in <i>Shirley</i>, Paul Emanuel in <i>Villette</i>), and he cost her two years of intense heartache, humiliation and futile hope. But Charlotte was also struggling with the larger issue of how she would ever accommodate her strong feelings&#x2014;whether of love for Heger, or her intellectual passions, or her anger at circumstances and feelings of thwarted destiny&#x2014;in the life that life seemed to have in store for her, one of patchy, unsatisfying employment, loneliness and hard work. What was someone like her, a plain, poor, clever, half-educated, dependent spinster daughter, to do with her own spiritual vitality and unfettered imagination? How could she live with the painful &#x201c;consciousness of faculties unexercised&#x201d; that had moved her to go abroad in the first place, and that she recognised, from the example of her equally brilliant siblings, not as some sort of freakishness, but as an intimation of the sublime?<br><br> Coming away from the huge cathedral in the dark, Charlotte was already calculating how she would evade any consequences of the priest&#x2019;s interest in her situation, and she had no intention of ever repeating her experiment. But her moment of freedom in the confessional was a pivotal one. Far from home, speaking in a whisper in a foreign language to a priest of an utterly alien faith, she was able to express what had been an intolerable burden to contain. As Lucy Snowe in <i>Villette</i> says of her own confession, &#x201c;the mere relief of communication in an ear which was human and sentient, yet consecrated&#x2014;the mere pouring out of some portion of long accumulating, long pent-up pain into a vessel whence it could not be again diffused&#x2014;had done me good. I was already solaced.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlotte Bront�&#x2019;s solace went further than the immediate comfort of confessional release. Her experience in Ste-Gudule gave her an idea not just of how to survive or override her most powerful feelings, but of how to transmute them into art. Within the year she was writing her first novel, <i>The Professor</i>, and, soon after that, sending out her poems to publishers with those of her sisters, under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The &#x201c;relief of communication&#x201d; was in telling the truth: not to a stranger in the darkness in a whispered foreign tongue, but to readers, through her works.<br><br>Two weeks after Charlotte&#x2019;s visit to Ste-Gudule, the young Queen of England was in Brussels, on an official visit to her uncle Leopold, who, in 1831, had been made the first monarch of the new kingdom of Belgium. Victoria was an object of wonder across the globe&#x2014;so young, so powerful, so female&#x2014;and the sisters in Haworth had been fascinated by her ever since she came to the throne in 1837, a newly minted monarch of their own age and gender, ushering in a new age. Charlotte went out to see the royal party pass, and reported back to Emily, eager for any impressions. &#x201c;I saw her for an instant flashing through the Rue Royale in a carriage and six, surrounded by soldiers,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;She was laughing and talking, very gaily.&#x201d;<br><br> Five years later, the insignificant little Englishwoman in the cheering crowd who had watched Victoria flash by would be keeping that queen and half the nation awake with the novel she had written.</p><h2>A Deadly Tail: A Whiskey, Tango &amp; Foxtrot Mystery (A Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Mystery, 4)</h2><p><p><b>Deirdre "Foxtrot" Lancaster returns-with her otherworldly animal companions Whiskey and Tango-to shine a light on the dark side of fame... </b></p><p> Foxtrot has seen a lot of strange things as assistant to billionaire Zelda Zoransky at her wacky mansion.

So it's no surprise to find a horde of zombies lurching across the lawn-even if they are just actors in a horror movie that's filming on the mansion grounds.

A zombie film is being shot at the estate; when an unidentifiable body turns up and an explosion injures one of the stars, Foxtrot decides it is up to her to solve both the murder and the bombing. The vast and paranormally energized pet cemetery on the grounds, known as the Great Crossroads, also sees its own suspicious activity. An unknown cat almost identical to Tango shows up, as well as some deceased &#34;actors,&#34; which include the ghosts of Lassie and Roy Rogers&#39;s horse Trigger, but no one can figure out why the ghosts have appeared and why they&#39;re sticking around. As the trio piece the clues together, Lyle&#39;s use of puns keeps readers laughing, intrigued, and entertained right up until the director calls &#34;Cut!&#34; Agent: Lucienne Diver, Knight Agency.

Its houses are mostly deserted ruins and have been for years. Ainielle's last surviving inhabitant, an old man at death's door, lingers on, and as the "yellow rain" of leaves flutters around him and the first snows of the year fall, he recalls the life he lived and the ghosts-once his friends and neighbors-who have taken possession of his solitude.<br> Hailed on first publication and continuously reprinted in Spain, The Yellow Rain is a haunting ode to the power of memory, an elegy for a landscape and a way of life.<br> <br></p><p>Born in the now-vanished town of Veg�mian in 1955, Julio Llamazares is one of Europe's most celebrated writers. He has written novels, poetry, and several travel books and is a regular contributor to El Pais. He lives in Madrid.<br>In this somber and elegiac novel, Llamazares's first to be translated into English, the last, dying resident of a deserted village in the Spanish Pyrenees, "forgotten by everyone, condemned to gnaw away at my memory and my bones like an old dog," summons the ghosts of his past. The closing of the local mill sent Ainielle's population to other towns, until only the elderly narrator and his wife, Sabine, remained. Lonely and grieving, Sabine killed herself, and the old man is left with only his loyal, sorrowful dog. Now, on what seems to be his final night on earth, he recalls the tragedies that have befallen him: his daughter, Sara, died when she was only four; the Spanish Civil War claimed his son Camilo; and his other beloved son, Andres (the narrator's namesake), "abandoned" his family to seek his fortune. The old man has never forgiven Andres, nor anyone else who left the village to rot, its houses collapsing "like an animal felled by a bullet." Llamazares's gorgeous prose evokes the empty streets and desolate landscape as effectively as it suggests ambiguities in the narrative's truth: is Andr&#x201a;s the elder a crazy, potentially dangerous man who sees visions of the dead? Or is he himself a ghost? A gorgeous, heartbreaking meditation on memory and solitude, and a poetic accounting of physical and spiritual decay, Llamazares's slender novel transports readers to a grim and unforgettable world. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tense and disturbing, it's the most explosive and ambitious story Greg Iles has ever written.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:</strong> Greg Iles has written a sprawling, gothic, suspenseful, emotional, page-turner of a book. In doing so, he&#x2019;s confronted the darkest secrets of his home state of Mississippi. Shifting between the 1960s (not a pretty period in Mississippi history) and the present, it&#x2019;s the story of a respected doctor accused of murdering his former nurse, an African-American woman who has returned to Natchez after many years up north. The doctor&#x2019;s son, Penn Cage (featured in previous Iles novels), is a former prosecutor, now the mayor of Natchez, whose attempts to clear his father bring him face to face with a fringe KKK sect, men who personify the South&#x2019;s historic evils. Packed to the point of overflow with racial politics, family secrets, illicit love, corruption, racism, brutality, and fear, this 800-page book is really a father-son story. Yet, as Iles suggests in the opening pages: &#x201c;Perhaps we expect too much of our fathers.&#x201d; Though it&#x2019;s sometimes easier not to acknowledge life&#x2019;s most uncomfortable truths, as one character puts it, &#x201c;Sooner or later, everything comes to the surface, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Smart, funny, and sexy, you&#x2019;ll keep thinking about it long after the violent final pages. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p> Joseph Finder <p><b></b></p><b>Guest Review by Joseph Finder, New York Times bestselling author of Paranoia, Buried Secrets, and the forthcoming Suspicion (On Sale 5/27/14).</b><p></p> <p>Greg Iles&#x2019;s long-awaited new novel is a big deal, and I do mean big. In this age of 140-character tweets and text messages, there&#x2019;s something wonderfully old-fashioned about the pleasure of losing yourself in the fully realized, immersive fictional world of a 788-page story. I&#x2019;m reminded of Larry McMurtry&#x2019;s Lonesome Dove (945 pages), or the great sagas of Herman Wouk, James Michener, and James Clavell. The best big novels, like Iles&#x2019;s instant classic, Natchez Burning, pull you in so deep that you&#x2019;re utterly transported; they don&#x2019;t seem long at all. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve always been a big fan of Greg Iles&#x2019; work. From Spandau Phoenix to Turning Angel, and his most recent, The Devil&#x2019;s Punchbowl (just to name a few favorites), he never repeats himself. He&#x2019;s a graceful writer who knows how to tell a gripping, fast-moving story&#x2014;without sacrificing texture or fully fleshed-out characters. </p><p> The central plot of Natchez Burning starts with Mayor Penn Cage, an attorney Iles introduced in 1999&#x2019;s The Quiet Game, learning that his father, the town&#x2019;s most beloved physician, is about to be charged with murder. The victim? Dr. Cage&#x2019;s former nurse, Viola Turner, who came home to Natchez to die after a nearly 40-year absence. </p><p> Did his father assist in Viola&#x2019;s suicide? Penn would believe it: his father did the same for Penn&#x2019;s own wife when she was dying of cancer, years before. But as the town&#x2019;s corrupt district attorney pursues the case, it becomes clear that Viola&#x2019;s death was no gentle passage into that good night. In fact, a crusading local reporter has video evidence that Viola died in pain and fear. Penn refuses to believe his father had anything to do with that. </p><p> Iles weaves this multi-generational web like a master, keeping Penn Cage at the center even as we see his father, Dr. Tom Cage, in both past and present, along with the many citizens of Natchez and its sister community in Louisiana, just across the Mississippi River. </p><p> Natchez Burning is an epic, a saga, but it&#x2019;s also a thriller. We feel the panic and terror of young Jimmy Revels as he walks into the Double Eagles&#x2019; trap in 1968. And the rage and despair of Lincoln Turner, Viola&#x2019;s son, who doesn&#x2019;t know the truth of his own origins. We feel Caitlin Masters&#x2019; desperate need to tell the story through the newspaper she publishes. Sustaining all of this tension for almost 800 pages is no small feat. It&#x2019;s a testament to Greg Iles&#x2019;s power as a storyteller. </p><p> Iles doesn&#x2019;t tie up all the loose ends. Natchez Burning is just the first installment in what promises to be an extraordinary trilogy built upon the premise that, in some pockets of the South, the Civil War hasn&#x2019;t ended. &#x201c;Appomattox hadn&#x2019;t ended anything,&#x201d; a character thinks early in the story, in a scene set in 1968. &#x201c;[It] had merely heralded an intermission. &#x201d; As William Faulkner said (and this book&#x2019;s narrator quotes), &#x201c;The past is never dead. It&#x2019;s not even past. &#x201d; In Natchez Burning, the sins and unpunished crimes of the generations who fought integration and civil rights are visited upon their children and grandchildren, claiming victims almost half a century later.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p><p></p><p>#1&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author Greg Iles returns with his most eagerly anticipated novel yet and his first in five years&#x2014;<em>Natchez Burning</em>&#x2014;the first installment in an epic trilogy that interweaves crimes, lies, and secrets past and present in a mesmerizing thriller featuring Southern lawyer and former prosecutor Penn Cage.</p><p>Growing up in the rural Southern hamlet of Natchez, Mississippi, Penn Cage learned everything he knows about honor and duty from his father, Tom Cage. But now the beloved family doctor and pillar of the community is accused of murdering Violet Turner, the beautiful nurse with whom he worked in the dark days of the early 1960s. A fighter who has always stood for justice, Penn is determined to save his father, even though Tom, stubbornly evoking doctor-patient privilege, refuses to speak up in his own defense.</p><p>The quest for answers sends Penn deep into the past&#x2014;into the heart of a conspiracy of greed and murder involving the Double Eagles, a vicious KKK crew headed by one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the state. With the aid of a local friend and reporter privy to some of Natchez's oldest and deadliest secrets, Penn follows a bloody trail that stretches back forty years, to one undeniable fact: no one&#x2014;black or white, young or old, brave or not&#x2014;is ever truly safe.</p><p>With everything on the line, including his own life, Penn must decide how far he will go to protect those he loves . . . and see justice done, once and for all.</p><p>Rich in Southern atmosphere and electrifying plot turns,&nbsp;<em>Natchez Burning</em>&nbsp;marks the brilliant return of a genuine American master of suspense. Tense and disturbing, it is the most explosive, exciting, sexy, and ambitious story Greg Iles has written yet.</p></p><h2>Treasury of Humor</h2><p>More than 1000 jokes make this a marvelous collection of humorous anecdotes and witty tidbits.

She was in town visiting for the weekend and we both agreed to celebrate by getting dressed up and going clubbing in L.A. We got ready in Noah&#x2019;s practice studio, crowded with guitars and amplifiers and speakers stacked up to the ceiling. I squeezed into a red dress that Clare loaned me. It was tight and low cut, something my dad would probably ground me for wearing, which was reason enough to embrace it. I slipped my arm under the silky strap, watching the tattoo of a bird on my wrist happily soar through. <b><p></p> </b>Clare&#x2019;s black strapless dress sparkled with tiny sequins. We sauntered down the hallway like we were strutting down a catwalk. When we turned into the living room we found Pat and Noah just as we&#x2019;d left them over an hour before&#x2014;sitting on the couch wearing jeans and T-shirts and working off their manly testosterone by battling it out over a soccer video game. I now understood why guys played video games&#x2014;they needed something to do to kill time while they waited for girls to get ready. <b><p></p> </b>Pat and Noah shared a typical bachelor pad: every inch of wall space was covered in digital screens, and every piece of furniture was black leather with built-in drink holders, back massagers, footrests, and video-control pads. The bottom cushion of one seat was propped up to reveal a minifridge (since taking four steps to the kitchen was such an inconvenience). <b><p></p> </b>Clare cleared her throat, and Pat&#x2019;s eyes flickered toward us. He paused the game and stared for a few seconds, confused, like we were strangers who&#x2019;d let ourselves in without knocking. <b><p></p> </b>"Wow," Noah said. "You two look amazing." <b><p></p> </b>"What&#x2019;s the occasion?" Pat asked. <b><p></p> </b>Clare raised her arms like it was obvious. "Aren&#x2019;t we going dancing?" <b><p></p> </b>"Yeah," Noah said. "But we&#x2019;re just going to Nino&#x2019;s." <b><p></p> </b>Clare&#x2019;s shoulders sank and she shook her head. <b><p></p> </b>"What&#x2019;s Nino&#x2019;s?" I asked. <b><p></p> </b>Noah blinked with surprise. "You&#x2019;ve never heard of it? It&#x2019;s a virtual dance club. It&#x2019;s going off tonight." <b><p></p> </b>My face fell. "It&#x2019;s virtual? Isn&#x2019;t the point of going out to be around people? There&#x2019;s got to be real dance clubs in this city." <b><p></p> </b>"There will be people there," Noah said. "It just makes getting rejected by women a little easier for Pat." <b><p></p> </b>"You&#x2019;re hilarious." Pat snickered. <b><p></p> </b>"Maybe <i>your</i> ego needs some rejection once in a while, Noah," Clare informed her brother, whose band, the Managers, had been getting national attention since they recorded their latest album in L.A. Clare made it a priority to deflate his star status whenever she got the opportunity. "How many girls call you on a typical day?" she asked. <b><p></p> </b>Noah brushed some shaggy dark hair out of his eyes. "You mean call or text or voice-text or videochat or message or contact?" <b><p></p> </b>Clare groaned and ran her fingers through her short brown hair. "This, I haven&#x2019;t missed." Pat&#x2019;s phone beeped and I noticed his eyebrows arch when he checked the screen. He started to type a message. <b><p></p> </b>"Who&#x2019;s that?" I asked him. <b><p></p> </b>"Probably Noah&#x2019;s latest groupie," Clare offered. <b><p></p> </b>"Don&#x2019;t talk about your mom that way," Pat responded. Before Clare and Noah could throw out a reply, I grabbed Clare&#x2019;s hand and pulled her toward the door. <b><p></p> </b>"Let&#x2019;s get out of here," I voted. "Nino&#x2019;s sounds . . . interesting." <b><p></p> </b>"There&#x2019;s a hundred-dollar cover," Pat said as he continued to type on his phone. <b><p></p> </b>"A hundred dollars?" Clare and I said together. <b><p></p> </b>"It&#x2019;s the hottest club in L.A., a hundred&#x2019;s cheap," Noah said. "I&#x2019;ll treat. It&#x2019;s my idea anyway." <b><p></p> </b>"For that price, it better come with model escorts," I said. <b><p></p> </b>Pat turned off the wall screen and grabbed a jacket. "You won&#x2019;t be disappointed," he promised.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p><b> <p></p></b> The four of us piled into a ZipLimo and headed downtown to Third and La Cienega. Noah insisted the trick to getting celebrity treatment in L.A. was arriving in style. ZipLimos were in limited supply in the city, but Pat knew a promoter who reserved one for us. <b><p></p> </b>We swiped our fingerprints before the shuttle took off. My dad had set up a temporary fake profile connected to my fingerprint so police wouldn&#x2019;t be able to track my movements, but my father still had constant access to my whereabouts. I was still on his leash. <b><p></p> </b>Clare ran her hand along the leather upholstery, and blue interior lights cast an electric glow inside the tight space. I leaned back in the seat and absorbed the smooth acceleration of the car. I was learning I needed motion in my life. I craved it, as if the movement outside of me charged movement inside. It reminded me I was more than a stationary object. I had legs for a reason. I wasn&#x2019;t meant to be molded to a chair. <b><p></p> </b>Pat sat next to me, and his jacket sleeve brushed against my arm. I scooted over to give him room, or maybe because I felt safer putting space between us. In the four weeks I&#x2019;d been in L.A., I&#x2019;d spent most of my time with Pat. He was one of my only friends in town and even though I had my brother, Joe, he embraced the digital life&#x2014;he worked, exercised, socialized, and dated on his computer. I&#x2019;d seen him for only a few hours since I&#x2019;d been in town, and I lived with him. But living had become so computerized, we rarely interacted in person. Even though we were divided only by three-inch-thick walls, we were living in separate worlds that clashed when they connected, like purple on red. <b><p></p> </b>"You should move down here," I told Clare. I missed her energy. She was the friendship equivalent of a shot of caffeine. <b><p></p> </b>"I have to get back in a few days. I have a date," she said with a bored expression, like a date was up there with vacuuming as her idea of fun. "I don&#x2019;t know why I bother." <b><p></p> </b>"Which site are you using?" Noah asked. <b><p></p> </b>"I prefer masochistic dating," Clare said. "You know, face-to-face. I met this guy at a coffee shop." <b><p></p> </b>Noah whistled through his teeth. "Impressive." <b><p></p> </b>Clare shrugged. "It beats those awkward online interview dates any day," she said. <b><p></p> </b>We all shuddered at this. My parents didn&#x2019;t allow me to date, but I knew there were hundreds of match sites. They claimed they could pair you with your soul mate in thirty days or less, or your money back. They could go as far as genetic profiling, so you could see blueprints of your future kids. We wanted fast love. Drive-through dating. And we got it. <b><p></p> </b>"I refuse to use dating sites," Clare announced. "Technology can now bring us love for six hundred dollars?" <b><p></p> </b>"A lot of my friends like them," Pat said. <b><p></p> </b>"It&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s set up like a video game," Clare said. "You have to make it to level ten before you can virtually meet. And you have to rack up points in order to advance to the next dating stage." <b><p></p> </b>Pat smiled. "Exactly. It&#x2019;s like playing online soccer, except I&#x2019;m trying to score with a girl." <b><p></p> </b>"Romantic," I said. "Don&#x2019;t worry, Clare. Someday you&#x2019;ll get swept off your feet." <b><p></p> </b>"More likely by a train than a guy," she said with a shrug, as if this were her fate and she&#x2019;d already accepted it. "We haven&#x2019;t heard from you in a while," Clare mentioned to Pat. I knew what she was referring to. Since he had moved to L.A. to help manage Noah&#x2019;s band, he&#x2019;d dropped his friends back in Oregon. <b><p></p> </b>Pat shrugged. "I&#x2019;m taking a break from all that," he said. <b><p></p> </b>"You&#x2019;re not going to fight digital school anymore?" I asked. <b><p></p> </b>His hazel eyes met mine. "It&#x2019;s not the most dire concern in my life." <b><p></p> </b>"Not when there&#x2019;s excellent music to produce," Noah added. <b><p></p> </b>"So you&#x2019;re just giving up?" Clare asked. <b><p></p> </b>Pat flashed her an annoyed frown. "No, I&#x2019;m just not that dedicated. I have other goals besides racing to save America&#x2019;s youth from a world of digital prison," he said. Pat always had a sarcastic side, especially when he was in the presence of me and Clare, but he&#x2019;d never spoken against fighting DS before. <b><p></p> </b>"What if Justin needs your help?" I pressed. <b><p></p> </b>Pat checked a message on his phone. "I&#x2019;m not off the schedule completely. You can call me a seasonal employee. I help out when we&#x2019;re understaffed." He met my eyes. "Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, DS sucks, but now that I&#x2019;m out of it, it doesn&#x2019;t seem as bad. School&#x2019;s just a part of life. You survive the monotonous boredom, you get out and move on. It&#x2019;s like your mandatory torture years." <b><p></p> </b>"That&#x2019;s not why we&#x2019;re fighting it," Clare argued. <b><p></p> </b>Noah&#x2019;s eyes were skeptical. "Hey, rebel twins, a lot of people actually like digital school. You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re up against." <b><p></p> </b>He looked from me to Clare and laughed at our identical frowns. <b><p></p> </b>"DS is easy," Noah said. "You don&#x2019;t have to waste time getting places. You don&#x2019;t have to put up with all the drama being face-to-face creates. You don&#x2019;t even have to get out of bed. I spent my entire high school career in my pajamas." <b><p></p> </b>"Thrilling," I said. "There&#x2019;s a word for not getting out of bed all day. It&#x2019;s <i>depression</i>." <b><p></p> </b>"You have more time to do the things you want," Noah argued. "It&#x2019;s not that bad." <b><p></p> </b>"It&#x2019;s a trap," I said. "People don&#x2019;t know how to exist outside of it, that&#x2019;s the problem. People might not be experiencing drama, but they&#x2019;re also not experiencing anything else. It&#x2019;s taking over our entire culture." <b><p></p> </b>"Hey, Debby Downers, can we talk about something fun?" Pat asked. "Besides, Maddie, it&#x2019;s not like you&#x2019;re committed to fighting DS," he reminded me. Just as he spoke, the limo turned the corner onto Third Street, and a neon billboard sign for Club Nino blinked down at us. A long line stretched along the side of the building, and the crowd turned to gape at the limo when we slowed down in front of the entrance. Some people were already poised to take videos, hands up and phones ready. Noah opened the door and we were greeted by a short bouncer in a suit and tie who held a scanner in his hand like a gun ready to fire at anyone who dared question his guest list. <b><p></p> </b>"Bouncers," Pat mumbled under his breath. "They think they own the city." <b><p></p> </b>The bouncer asked us if we had reservations, and judging from his deadpan expression, we could have shown up hovering in a spacecraft and he wouldn&#x2019;t have been impressed. <b><p></p> </b>I started to shake my head but Pat announced we needed four seats. <b><p></p> </b>"We&#x2019;re at capacity," the bouncer said. "You&#x2019;ll have to get in the back of the line." <b><p></p> </b>Pat shrugged. "All right, if you want to turn down a member of the Managers. It might hurt your image, but that&#x2019;s your call." <b><p></p> </b>A few girls in the front of the line had already recognized Noah and started yelling his name. When he turned to wave he was greeted with shrieks and a swarm of lights from camera phones. A dozen glittery dresses bounced up and down. <b><p></p> </b>"Come on," Pat said, and pulled at Noah&#x2019;s sleeve. "Isn&#x2019;t your music label throwing a party tonight?" <b><p></p> </b>The bouncer&#x2019;s tight frown relaxed. "Wait, let me see what I can do," he said, his tone changing from snobbery to flattery in less than a second. "I might have a few VIP seats open." He typed on his screen, mumbled orders into his earpod, and, after scanning our fingerprints, ushered us through a side door and then up a flight of metal stairs. Noah turned and waved once more to his fans and was answered with shrieks so loud it made Clare cringe next to me. <b><p></p> </b>"I think the trick t...</p><h2>Taste of America</h2><p>The Taste of America is both a history of American cooking and a history of the advice smiling celebrity cooks have asked Americans to swallow.</p><p>This classic barbeque of our foodways is as valid and as savory today as when it first tickled ribs a generation ago.

This eccentric family handles the mysterious reptile remarkably well, even though the beast seems to have an appetite as fierce as its legendary bite. The Christmas Crocodile tears around the house eating everything in sight, whether edible (a roast, five golden oranges, a pineapple upside-down cake) or inedible (a shoe, ribbons, a feather boa, earmuffs, and fruitcake). The family is divided over how to best deal with this unexpected guest. Send him to an orphanage? Pack him off to the zoo? Make him into a pair of shoes? "He's nice," said Alice Jayne. "Maybe we could keep him." Just when it seems the crocodile has eaten all he can stomach, the family awakens to discover that he has consumed nearly all the presents and the Christmas tree too! The one uneaten gift holds the key to this toothsome tale, as well as a surprise that will have kids smiting their foreheads in gleeful anticipation of more mayhem to come. <p> Author Bonny Becker has crafted a rollicking reptile romp, with an apologetic refrain--"The Christmas Crocodile didn't mean to be bad, not really"--to which children can surely relate. David Small, creator of the Caldecott Honor-winning <i>The Gardener</i>, accompanies Becker's spritely, funny text with equally amusing, expressive illustrations that will have youngsters poring over this book long after the last present has been unwrapped. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Brangien Davis</i></p>One Christmas morning, many years ago, <b>Bonny Becker</b> found a dachshund puppy with a big red bow around his neck under her Christmas tree. He promptly chewed up a slipper. He joined a family of six children, two eccentric parents, and abundant love and chaos.

With compelling immediacy, she depicts the struggles of men and women torn by their convictions and challenged by the perils of war.<br>July 1917. Joseph Reavley, a chaplain, and his sister, Judith, an ambulance driver, are bone-weary as they approach the fourth year of the conflict; the peace of the English countryside seems a world away. On the Western Front, the Battle of Passchendaele has begun, and among the many fatalities from Joseph&#x2019;s regiment is the trusted commanding officer, who is replaced by a young major whose pompous incompetence virtually guarantees that many good soldiers will die needlessly. But soon he, too, is dead&#x2013;killed by his own men. Although Joseph would like to turn a blind eye, he knows that he must not. Judith, however, anguished at the prospect of courts-martial and executions for the twelve men arrested for the crime, has no such inhibitions and, risking of her own life, helps all but one of the prisoners to escape.<br><br>Back in England, Joseph and Judith&#x2019;s brother, Matthew, continues his desperate pursuit to unmask the sinister figure known as the Peacemaker&#x2013;an obsessed genius who has committed murder and treason in an attempt to stop Britain from winning the war. As Matthew trails the Peacemaker, Joseph tracks his comrades through Switzerland and into enemy territory. His search will lead to a reckoning pitting courage and honor against the blind machinery of military justice.<br><br><i>At Some Disputed Barricade</i> is an Anne Perry masterpiece&#x2013;brilliant, surprising, and unforgettable.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of the World War I novels <i>No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky,</i> and <i>Angels in the Gloom</i>; as well as four holiday novels: A <i>Christmas Journey, A Christmas Visitor, A Christmas Guest,</i> and <i>A Christmas Secret.</i> She is also the creator of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England.

His face was ashen and streaked with mud and sweat.<br><br>"Chaplain! Snowy's gone!" he cried, bumping into the earthen wall and stopping in front of Joseph. "Oi think he's gone over the top!" His voice was hoarse with helplessness and despair.<br><br>That morning Snowy Nunn had seen his elder brother sawn in half by machine gun fire in yet another pointless attack. It was now late July 1917, and this mid-Cambridgeshire regiment had been bogged down on this same stretch of ruined land between Pyres and Passchendaele since the beginning, those far-off days of courage and hope when they had imagined it would all be over by Christmas.<br><br>Now mutilation and death were everyday occurrences. The earth stank of three years' worth of latrines, poison gas, and corpses. But it was still different to see the brother you had grown up with reduced to bleeding jelly in front of your eyes. At first Snowy had been too stunned to do anything, as if the sheer horror of it had paralyzed him.<br><br>"I think he's gone over," Barshey repeated. "He's lost it. He's gone to kill the whole German army himself. They'll just wipe him out." He gulped.<br><br>"We'll get him back," Joseph said with far more certainty than he felt. "He might have been taken back to the first aid post. Have you--"<br><br>"Oi looked," Barshey interrupted him. "And in the cookhouse, and Oi looked in all the dugouts and the holes big enough for anyone to crawl in. He's gone over the top, Captain Reavley."<br><br>Joseph's stomach clenched. It was pointless to cling to hope they both knew was futile. "You go north, I'll go south," he said briefly. "But be careful! Don't get yourself killed for nothing!"<br><br>Barshey gave a bark of laughter so harsh it was almost a sob, and turned away. Joseph started in the opposite direction, south and west toward the place where a man could most easily go over the parapet and find the shelter of what was left of the trees--shell-torn, blackened, and mostly leafless, even now in full summer.<br><br>" 'Evenin', Chaplain," the sentry said quietly from his position on the fire step, peering forward into the gathering gloom. The German guns were rumbling sullenly, starting the night's barrage, flashes from their muzzles red. The British answered. There were Canadian and Australian regiments up in this section, too.<br><br>"Evening," Joseph answered. "Seen Snowy Nunn?" He had too little time left to afford discretion. Grief had shattered all sense of self-preservation. Of course Snowy had seen men killed before: burned, drowned, gassed, frozen, or blown to pieces, some caught on the wire and riddled with bullets. But when it was your own brother, there was something that tore you in an inner way that nothing else could reach. Tucky had been his childhood friend and protector, the companion in his first adventures, the one who first told him daring jokes, the one who had stood up for him in the school playground. It was as if half his own life had been destroyed obscenely right in front of him.<br>Joseph had seen Snowy's face, and known that when the first numbing shock wore off his emotion would turn to rage. He had just expected it to take longer.<br><br>"Have you seen him?" he asked the sentry again, this time more sharply.<br><br>"Don't know, Captain Reavley," the sentry answered. "Oi bin watching forward."<br><br>"He hasn't done anything," Joseph said, clenching his teeth to keep control of the helplessness rising inside him. "I want to get to him before he does!" He knew what the man was protecting. Joseph was an officer and a priest, tied to the command by both rank and conviction. There were whispers that men in the French army had already mutinied, said they would hold their positions but would not launch any attack. They had demanded improved rations and whatever humanity of treatment was possible in this universal misery. Thousands had been charged, and over four hundred had been sentenced to death, but so far apparently very few had actually faced the firing squad.<br><br>In the British Army the losses had been equally appalling. Men were exhausted and morale was low, but as yet no mutiny. Now there was talk of another push forward against the German lines and there was no heart left for it. Everyone had seen too many friends dead or crippled to gain a few yards of clay, and nothing had changed, except the numbers of the dead. The sentry's sympathies were with the men, and he was afraid.<br><br>"Please!" Joseph said urgently. "His brother was killed and he's in a bad way. I need to find him."<br><br>"And tell him what?" the sentry said raspingly, turning at last to face Joseph. "That there's a God up there who loves us and it'll turn out all right in the end?" His voice was raw with misery.<br><br>Joseph had not expressed that sentiment in a long time. Certainly such words were no help. Young men of nineteen or twenty who had been sent out to die, in a hell those at home could not even imagine, did not want to be told by a priest almost twice their age, who had at least had a chance at life, that God loved them in spite of every evidence to the contrary.<br><br>"I just want to prevent him from doing something stupid before he's had time to think," he said aloud. "I know his mother. I'd like to get one son back to her."<br><br>The sentry did not answer. He turned back to face over the parapet again. The sky was fading into a soft, bright peach trailed across by a wisp of scarlet cloud, still burning in the sun. There were a few naked trees in Railway Wood to the west, silhouetted black against the hot color, more ahead over the German lines beyond Glencorse and Polygon Woods. That was the direction toward which they'd mount the attack.<br><br>"Oi don't know," the sentry said at last. "But you could troy Zoave Wood." He jerked his hand to the right. "There's one or two decent places over there you could sit boi yourself. If that was what you wanted."<br><br>"Thank you." Joseph moved on quickly. Ahead of him he heard rats' feet scraping along the boards. The trenches were full of them, millions scavenging among the unburied dead. Men went out at night, Joseph often among them, and brought back the bodies, the living first, then what dead they could.<br><br>He passed the dugouts off to the side where stretchers and extra first aid supplies were kept, although each man was supposed to carry with him at least the basics to stanch a wound. It was getting dark and occasionally star shells burst above, briefly lighting the mud with a yellow-white glare, leaving men in momentary blindness afterward.<br><br>He still did not know what he was going to say to Snowy when he found him. Perhaps there was nothing more he could do than be there, sit with him in the long agonized silence. Snowy probably would not ask him the impossible questions. He had ceased to imagine there were any answers, and certainly none that Joseph knew. Snowy was over twenty, a veteran. Most of these boys coming out now had been taken from the schoolroom. When they were broken and dying, it was their mothers they called for, not God. Out here what was there to say to God? Joseph was not sure how many people believed in such a being anymore, or thought that if He was there, then He was just as helpless as everyone else.<br><br>The trench walls were deep here, the sides firmly riveted with wood. <br><br>He passed a couple of men squatting on their heels over a Dixie can of tea.<br><br>"Seen Snowy Nunn?" he asked, stopping beside them. <br><br>One lifted a pale face, smeared with mud, a long scar across his cheek. Joseph recognized him as Nobby. "Sorry, Cap'n, not lately, poor sod. Tucky were a good chap." There was no horror in his voice and his eyes stared beyond Joseph into a distance no one else could see.<br><br>"Thanks, Nobby," Joseph acknowledged, and moved on quickly. There were more sentries, a group of men telling tall stories to each other and laughing. Somebody was singing a music hall song with risque alterations to the words.<br><br>Joseph passed an officers' dugout, its entrance down steep steps. It was narrow as a tomb, but at least it was safe from sniper fire, and in the winter as warm as anyone could be in the frozen earth. He emerged from the confining walls of the trench into Zoave Wood. Most of the trees here were blasted or burned, but a few still had leaves. Beneath them the earth that normally was covered with undergrowth was trampled flat. The front line passed right through what was left of the wood.<br><br>He stood close to the trunk of the nearest tree and felt its rough bark against his back. If Snowy was here in these few acres behind the line it was just a matter of walking quietly, crisscrossing it like a gamekeeper looking for a poacher. Except that Snowy would probably be motionless in his grief, alone, growing cold even in this summer night because he was exhausted not in body but in heart. Perhaps he was consumed by that terrible, inexplicable guilt that survivors feel when for no reason at all they live on after those they loved have died.<br><br>Joseph started to walk, placing his feet softly on the bare ground. The wind stirred in the few remaining leaves, and shadows flickered, but he could hear nothing else above the noise of the guns. It was a warm night and the stench of the dead mixed with that of the latrines was thick in his throat, although these days he hardly noticed it. It was there all the time. You had to get right away from the lines, into one of the towns, perhaps in an estaminet, and smell cheese and wine and sweat before you lost it. Fortunately there was opportunity for this in places like Poperinghe or Armentieres and the small villages within a few miles.<br></p><h2>Dig, Drill, Dump, Fill</h2><p>Introduces, through photographs alone, heavy construction machines: earth movers, mixers, diggers, and others.</p><p><p>Tana Hoban's photographs have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and in galleries around the world.

The first section of the work provides a concise critical analysis of some leading schools of thought in social philosophy, giving particular attention to phenomenology, ethnomethodology, and Wittgensteinian thought. Giddens concentrates primarily upon the implications of these various perspectives for an account of human action and its intelligibility. An 'action approach' on its own, however, will not do; in human social life, action and structure presuppose one another. The author therefore moves on to provide a series of concepts relevant to understanding the production and reproduction of society. The book concludes with a succinct statement of some 'new rules of sociological method.'</p><br><p>Representing the first, and most trenchant, exposition of the principles of structuration theory, this edition also contains a substantial new Introduction in which Giddens replies to some of the more persistent criticisms made of the original version and also addresses some important issues originally discussed only in a cursory way. </p></p><p>RThe book had an enormous impact when it was first published, and it has not &#39;dated&#39; in the least. Indeed, I would contend that it is perhaps the central work in Giddens&#39;s corpus and that it is as relevant today as when it was first published. New Rules, with its ambitious title patterned after Durkheim&#39;s classic work, was and remains an aggressive contribution to social theory. Well judged adjustments to the text, together with the new and substantial preface, only enhance the book in its new edition.S John Heritage, University of California, Los Angeles</p><h2>Among the Russians (Picador travel classics)</h2><p><p>Thubron learnt Russian and entered the then Soviet Union in an old Morris Marina in which he camped and drove for almost 10,000 miles between the Baltic and Caucasus.

More than a how-to text, this book is a rare glimpse into the inner sanctum of today's rough-tough politics. It offers hundreds of tips on how to run and how to win, without having to break your budget. Cathy Allen has run more than 150 campaigns in 30 states and three continents. Her Seattle-based company, Campaign Connection, has amassed an impressive list of successful statewide, congressional, issue and legislative election victories. Campaigns &amp; Elections magazine named Allen one of the most powerful women in American politics - and this book explains why.</p><p>I became consumed by campaigns and candidates 15 years ago and more than 250 campaigns ago. Governors and senators, congress members and mayors, state legislators and judges, initiatives and bonds - I have worked for the best. My business, Campaign Connection, was established seven years ago under the premise that women, people of color and members of the gay community need to be at the power tables of politics. At that time I authored Political Campaigning: A New Decade, a campaign manual that predicted women would begin to run in record numbers. The book correctly assumed that many women and candidates of color would win because the real people of this country were getting tired of politics as usual. They would want people who looked like them, worked like them, raised families like them, and reflected the same values as working America. Since that time, I have worked on campaigns from Alaska to New England; trained would-be political women and men from Florida to Hawaii; and helped put together special action committees in 14 states. Every election eve I face my own shortcomings, and live to realize that campaigns offer few guarantees. For every lesson I have learned, there are more exceptions than rules, and more interesting ideas that may work for one campaign, only to be bad news for another. However, there are some truths worth writing down - which is the purpose of this book. It was only in my own defense that I attempted this first how-to campaign manual written for the completely naive - or the selfless candidate who just wants more clues as to what&#39;s going on. In helping hundreds of candidates, it seems only too logical that there should be a text that could at least give candidates and managers some background and lessons learned from bitter and heartbreaking experiences. This book is that result.Cathy Allen started Campaign Connection seven years ago with a simple message: elect women, people of color and members of the gay community so we can level the playing field of politics for the rest of us. Some 120 campaigns later - with a 76 per cent winning record - Allen and her team have amassed an impressive list of successful statewide, Congressional, issue and legislative election victories. In 1991, Allen helped elect a super-majority of women to the Seattle City Council, setting a record that still stands in American local politics. In 1992, she was credited with a record number of women who won at the state legislative level, including her own Washington state which became the first state to reach 40% representation by women legislators. Campaigns and Elections Magazine named her as one of the most powerful women in American politics. In 1996, Allen&#39;s firm had a winning record, helping to elect candidates including Gary Locke and Terri Bergeson to key statewide and local positions. And, in January of this year, Allen was elected to the Board of Directors of the American Association of Political Consultants. An author and trainer, Allen wrote &#34;Political Campaigning: A New Decade,&#34; a nuts-and-bolts guide to winning in politics. Her latest book, &#34;Taking Back Politics,&#34; is the most comprehensive book on running and winning campaigns. It is now available to the public. She also has written more than 80 campaign manuals targeted toward strategies to fight the Far Right, elect women, or train trainers. Campaign Connection has built its reputation primarily as a direct mail, opposition research and press relations consulting business. For its work, Allen and Campaign Connection have received several prestigious awards, including many statewide and political consulting awards. Allen has trained candidates and provided political strategy in 42 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. She&#39;s worked on four continents, recently advising political parties in Croatia, Canada, and South America. The National Education Association, the National League of Women Voters, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and the New Democratic Party are among her clients. A Massachusetts native, Allen received her bachelor&#39;s degree in journalism from the University of Bridgeport (CT). She has a Master&#39;s Degree in Public Administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Prior to her political career, Ms. Allen worked as a newspaper reporter for the New York Times, the Anchorage Times and the Bridgeport Post. In addition to her campaign business, Allen also owns Community Connection, a public policy consulting business specializing in alternative citizen involvement and damage control.</p><h2>Painting as model</h2><p>Informed by both structuralism and poststructuralism, these essays by art critic and historian Yve-Alain Bois seek to redefine the status of theory in modernist critical discourse.</p><p>Informed by both structuralism and poststructuralism, these essays by art critic and historian Yve-Alain Bois seek to redefine the status of theory in modernist critical discourse.

He is author of the novels, I, Fatty, Perv: A Love Story, and Plainclothes, Naked. He currently lives in Los Angeles.It's not pretty and it's not "professional," but it's Jerry Stahl's true story of his life as a writer. Beginning his career as a pornographer for <i>Beaver</i> magazine, Stahl later wrote fake sex letters for <i>Penthouse</i> and articles for <i>Hustler</i> before moving on to write scripts for such TV hits as <i>Moonlighting, Thirtysomething,</i> and <i>Alf,</i> jobs that put almost $7,000 a week in his bank account. This is also the story of Stahl's addictions to smack, coke, crack, Dilaudids--you name it. Moving between $100 L.A. lunches and meetings with Cybill Shepherd to dangerous scores in the worst parts of the city, Stahl managed to lose his family, his house, his screenwriting opportunity for the second season of <i>Twin Peaks,</i> and nearly his life. <i>Permanent Midnight</i> is not for people with delicate sensibilities or any other low thresholds for truth. Stahl's autobiography provides no glitzy Hollywood confessional with raised letters on the dust jacket, and it's not a self-help book on recovery. Instead, it explores, with brutal honesty and humor, the author's struggle between the nightmares of addiction and the nightmares of sobriety. <i>Permanent Midnight</i> is one of the most harrowing and toughest accounts ever written in this century about what it means to be a junkie in America, making Burroughs look dated and Kerouac appear as the nose-thumbing adolescent he was.

All three books offer authoritative essays discussing form, media, style, meaning, and significance as well as the cultural, economic, and political context of producing art. And all three share a respectful approach toward the aborigines, whose nonmaterialist culture produced a rich aesthetic integrating artistic, spiritual, social, and intellectual systems. Dreamings , an exhibition catalog published jointly by The Asia Society Galleries and the South Australia museum, explores aboriginal art forms based on a belief in the "Dreaming" or "Dreamtime." This spiritual event, infusing the present as well as the past, dates from a time when Ancestral Beings roamed the world and shaped the formless landscape into the distinctive plant and animal life of the isolated continents. Imagery in bark paintings, sculpture, shields, and acrylics shows where aborigines have lived and traveled and how they have experienced the Beings. The Art of the First Fleet , published in association with the Australian Academy of the Humanities and the British Museum (Natural History), reproduces the original visual materials created during the first decade of the British settlement of New South Wales, as rendered by three members of the Sirius, one of the original 11 British ships that explored Australia in 1788. These materials have aesthetic, historical, and taxonomic importance. They are the first European depictions of Australian aborigines, and as the earliest drawings of certain plants, birds, mammals, and fishes, they established the formal description and naming of the flora and fauna. Baudin in Australian Waters similarly describes the works of two artists, C.A. Lesueur and N.M. Petit, who sailed with Capt. Nicolas Baudin's French voyage in 1800-04 and pictorially recorded the expedition's scientific endeavors and the changes in environment wrought by colonial development. This illustrated catalog of drawings and watercolors of native subjects (found in the Lesueur Collection at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Le Havre, France) combines scientific detail, accuracy, and design values. It is fascinating to compare contemporary British and French depictions of the same subject. Recommended as important resources for Australian art, culture, and history.

Today, anthropologists recognize their complex social patterns and rich cosmology, their centuries-old contacts with Melanesians and Indonesians, their pioneering of human cremation, rock art, tools and grindstones. So too with Aboriginal artit is slowly gaining recognition as one of the world's great artistic traditions. The Dreamtime of the Aborigines' bark paintings, acrylics, ceremonial objects and sculptures is both the sacred, life-giving dimension of the present and the realm in which ancestral spirits roam the landscape. Sutton, an anthropologist with the South Australian Museum, led a team of experts to put together this astonishing, gorgeous book and the landmark traveling exhibition it showcases. Works reproduced range from geometrical dreamscapes with startling similarities to modern abstract art, through mythic, psychological and erotic symbolism, to contemporary reworkings of the Aboriginal aesthetic in rugs, posters, ceramics and photography. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christmas Cats and Dogs: Quilts to Celebrate the Season</h2><p>Dress up a dozen cute cats and five jolly dogs for the holidays!

In a well-researched, engrossing, often-startling chronicle based on interviews, unpublished manuscript collections and Congressional records, the author alleges underworld involvement by numerous well-known figures, past and present, among them entertainers (Milton Berle), journalists (Walter Winchell), boxers (Floyd Patterson) and several U.S. presidents (FDR, Truman, JFK). He explores the ethnic and class dimension of organized crime, from Irish, Jewish and Italian bootleggers of the Prohibition era to the latest influx of newer immigrant groups, especially Latin and Asian gangsters. Deploring the cult of "Mafia chic" and the romanticization of criminals, Fox, in this quietly sensational account, leaves no doubt that the mob is still a national cancer. Photos. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."WASP anxiety" regarding immigrant criminals resulted in Prohibition--13 years which successfully transformed local gangs into the national criminal networks of today. With this as his thesis and starting point, historian Fox then reels off a series of vignettes that depict the struggle between WASP crime-fighter and ethnic criminal. Using an eclectic mix of sources ranging from original newspaper accounts to congressional hearings, the author has produced an almost encyclopedic popular history of organized crime in 20th-century America. Of special interest are chapters devoted to the Kennedy assassinations and aftermath and to the Mafia-as-myth school of sociology. This is an entertaining, thoughtful book covering old ground and much that is new.

You&#x2019;ll read them&#x2014;or they&#x2019;ll march. Some of them livid and some of them fiery and some of them rotten.</p><p>Some of them are corpses, skeletons, mummies, twitching, tottering, animated by companions that have been damned alive. There are giants that will walk by, though sound asleep. There are things that are theorems and things that are rags: they&#x2019;ll go by like Euclid arm in arm with the spirit of anarchy. Here and there will flit little harlots. Many are clowns. But many are of the highest respectability. Some are assassins. There are pale stenches and gaunt superstitions and mere shadows and lively malices: whims and amiabilities. The na�ve and the pedantic and the bizarre and the grotesque and the sincere and the insincere, the profound and the puerile.</p><p>A stab and a laugh and the patiently folded hands of hopeless propriety.</p><p>The ultra-respectable, but the condemned, anyway.</p><p>The aggregate appearance is of dignity and dissoluteness: the aggregate voice is a defiant prayer: but the spirit of the whole is processional.</p><p>The power that has said to all these things that they are damned, is Dogmatic Science.</p><p>But they&#x2019;ll march.</p><p>The little harlots will caper, and freaks will distract attention, and the clowns will break the rhythm of the whole with their buffooneries&#x2014;but the solidity of the procession as a whole: the impressiveness of things that pass and pass and pass, and keep on and keep on and keep on coming.</p><p>The irresistibleness of things that neither threaten nor jeer nor defy, but arrange themselves in mass-formations that pass and pass and keep on passing.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>SO, BY THE DAMNED, I mean the excluded.</p><p>But by the excluded I mean that which will some day be the excluding.</p><p>Or everything that is, won&#x2019;t be.</p><p>And everything that isn&#x2019;t, will be&#x2014;</p><p>But, of course, will be that which won&#x2019;t be&#x2014;</p><p>It is our expression that the flux between that which isn&#x2019;t and that which won&#x2019;t be, or the state that is commonly and absurdly called &#x201c;existence,&#x201d; is a rhythm of heavens and hells: that the damned won&#x2019;t stay damned; that salvation only precedes perdition. The inference is that some day our accursed tatterdemalions will be sleek angels. Then the sub-inference is that some later day, back they&#x2019;ll go whence they came.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>IT IS OUR EXPRESSION that nothing can attempt to be, except by attempting to exclude something else: that that which is commonly called &#x201c;being&#x201d; is a state that is wrought more or less definitely proportionately to the appearance of positive difference between that which is included and that which is excluded.</p><p>But it is our expression that there are no positive differences: that all things are like a mouse and a bug in the heart of a cheese. Mouse and a bug: no two things could seem more unlike. They&#x2019;re there a week, or they stay there a month: both are then only transmutations of cheese. I think we&#x2019;re all bugs and mice, and are only different expressions of an all-inclusive cheese.</p><p>Or that red is not positively different from yellow: is only another degree of whatever vibrancy yellow is a degree of: that red and yellow are continuous, or that they merge in orange.</p><p>So then that, if, upon the basis of yellowness and redness, Science should attempt to classify all phenomena, including all red things as veritable, and excluding all yellow things as false or illusory, the demarcation would have to be false and arbitrary, because things colored orange, constituting continuity, would belong on both sides of the attempted border-line.</p><p>As we go along, we shall be impressed with this:</p><p>That no basis for classification, or inclusion and exclusion, more reasonable than that of redness and yellowness has ever been conceived of.</p><p>Science has, by appeal to various bases, included a multitude of data. Had it not done so, there would be nothing with which to seem to be. Science has, by appeal to various bases, excluded a multitude of data. Then, if redness is continuous with yellowness: if every basis of admission is continuous with every basis of exclusion, Science must have excluded some things that are continuous with the accepted. In redness and yellowness, which merge in orangeness, we typify all tests, all standards, all means of forming an opinion&#x2014;</p><p>Or that any positive opinion upon any subject is illusion built upon the fallacy that there are positive differences to judge by&#x2014;</p><p>That the quest of all intellection has been for something&#x2014;a fact, a basis, a generalization, law, formula, a major premise that is positive: that the best that has ever been done has been to say that some things are self-evident&#x2014;whereas, by evidence we mean the support of something else&#x2014;</p><p>That this is the quest; but that it has never been attained; but that Science has acted, ruled, pronounced, and condemned as if it had been attained.</p><p>What is a house?</p><p>It is not possible to say what anything is, as positively distinguished from anything else, if there are no positive differences.</p><p>A barn is a house, if one lives in it. If residence constitutes houseness, because style of architecture does not, then a bird&#x2019;s nest is a house: and human occupancy is not the standard to judge by, because we speak of dogs&#x2019; houses; nor material, because we speak of snow houses of Eskimos&#x2014;or a shell is a house to a hermit crab&#x2014;or was to the mollusk that made it&#x2014;or things seemingly so positively different as the White House at Washington and a shell on the seashore are seen to be continuous.</p><p>So no one has ever been able to say what electricity is, for instance. It isn&#x2019;t anything, as positively distinguished from heat or magnetism or life. Metaphysicians and theologians and biologists have tried to define life. They have failed, because, in a positive sense, there is nothing to define: there is no phenomenon of life that is not, to some degree, manifest in chemism, magnetism, astronomic motions.</p><p>White coral islands in a dark blue sea.</p><p>Their seeming of distinctness: the seeming of individuality, or of positive difference one from another&#x2014;but all are only projections from the same sea bottom. The difference between sea and land is not positive. In all water there is some earth: in all earth there is some water.</p><p>So then that all seeming things are not things at all, if all are inter-continuous, any more than is the leg of a table a thing in itself, if it is only a projection from something else: that not one of us is a real person, if, physically, we&#x2019;re continuous with environment; if, psychically, there is nothing to us but expression of relation to environment.</p><p>Our general expression has two aspects:</p><p>Conventional monism, or that all &#x201c;things&#x201d; that seem to have identity of their own are only islands that are projections from something underlying, and have no real outlines of their own.</p><p>But that all &#x201c;things,&#x201d; though only projections, are projections that are striving to break away from the underlying that denies them identity of their own.</p><p>I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, in which and of which all seeming things are only different expressions, but in which all things are localizations of one attempt to break away and become real things, or to establish entity or positive difference or final demarcation or unmodified independence&#x2014;or personality or soul, as it is called in human phenomena&#x2014;</p><p>That anything that tries to establish itself as a real, or positive, or absolute system, government, organization, self, soul, entity, individuality, can so attempt only by drawing a line about itself, or about the inclusions that constitute itself, and damning or excluding, or breaking away from, all other &#x201c;things&#x201d;:</p><p>That, if it does not so act, it cannot seem to be;</p><p>That, if it does so act, it falsely and arbitrarily and futilely and disastrously acts, just as would one who draws a circle in the sea, including a few waves, saying that the other waves, with which the included are continuous, are positively different, and stakes his life upon maintaining that the admitted and the damned are positively different.</p><p>Our expression is that our whole existence is animation of the local by an ideal that is realizable only in the universal:</p><p>That, if all exclusions are false, because always are included and excluded continuous: that if all seeming of existence perceptible to us is the product of exclusion, there is nothing that is perceptible to us that really is: that only the universal can really be.</p><p>Our especial interest is in modern science as a manifestation of this one ideal or purpose or process:</p><p>That it has falsely excluded, because there are no positive standards to judge by: that it has excluded things that, by its own pseudo-standards, have as much right to come in as have the chosen.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>OUR GENERAL EXPRESSION:</p><p>That the state that is commonly and absurdly called &#x201c;existence,&#x201d; is a flow, or a current, or an attempt, from negativeness to positiveness, and is intermediate to both.</p><p>By positiveness we mean:</p><p>Harmony, equilibrium, order, regularity, stability, consistency, unity, realness, system, government, organization, liberty, independence, soul, self, personality, entity, individuality, truth, beauty, justice, perfection, definiteness&#x2014;</p><p>That all that is called development, progress, or evolution is movement toward, or attempt toward, this state for which, or for aspects of which, there are so many names, all of which are summed up in the one word &#x201c;positiveness.&#x201d;</p><p>At first this summing up may not be very readily acceptable. At first it may seem that all these words are not synonyms: that &#x201c;harmony&#x201d; may mean &#x201c;order,&#x201d; but that by &#x201c;independence,&#x201d; for instance, we do not mean &#x201c;truth,&#x201d; or that by &#x201c;stability&#x201d; we do not mean &#x201c;beauty,&#x201d; or &#x201c;system,&#x201d; or &#x201c;justice.&#x201d;</p><p>I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, which expresses itself in astronomic phenomena, and chemic, biologic, psychic, sociologic: that it is everywhere striving to localize positiveness: that to this attempt in various fields of phenomena&#x2014;which are only quasi-different&#x2014;we give different names. We speak of the &#x201c;system&#x201d; of the planets, and not of their &#x201c;government&#x201d;: but in considering a store, for instance, and its management, we see that the words are interchangeable. It used to be customary to speak of chemic equilibrium, but not of social equilibrium: that false demarcation has been broken down. We shall see that by all these words we mean the same state. As every-day conveniences, or in terms of common illusions, of course, they are not synonyms. To a child an earth worm is not an animal. It is to the biologist.</p><p>By &#x201c;beauty,&#x201d; I mean that which seems complete.</p><p>Obversely, that the incomplete, or the mutilated, is the ugly.</p><p>Venus de Milo.</p><p>To a child she is ugly.</p><p>When a mind adjusts to thinking of her as a completeness, even though, by physiologic standards, incomplete, she is beautiful.</p><p>A hand thought of only as a hand, may seem beautiful.</p><p>Found on a battlefield&#x2014;obviously a part&#x2014;not beautiful.</p><p>But everything in our experience is only a part of something else that in turn is only a part of still something else&#x2014;or that there is nothing beautiful in our experience: only appearances that are intermediate to beauty and ugliness&#x2014;that only universality is complete: that only the complete is the beautiful: that every attempt to achieve beauty is an attempt to give to the local the attribute of the universal.</p><p>By stability, we mean the immovable and the unaffected. But all seeming things are only reactions to something else. Stability, too, then, can be only the universal, or that besides which there is nothing else. Though some things seem to have&#x2014;or have&#x2014;higher approximations to stability than have others, there are, in our experience, only various degrees of intermediateness to stability and instability. Every man, then, who works for stability under its various names of &#x201c;permanency,&#x201d; &#x201c;survival,&#x201d; duration,&#x201d; is striving to localize in something the state that is realizable only in the universal.</p><p>By independence, entity, and individuality, I can mean only that besides which there is nothing else, if given only two things, they must be continuous and mutually affective, if everything is only a reaction to something else, and any two things would be destructive of each other&#x2019;s independence, entity, or individuality.</p><p>All attempted organizations and systems and consistencies, some approximating far higher than others, but all only intermediate to Order and Disorder, fail eventually because of their relations with outside forces. All are attempted completenesses. If to all local phenomena there are always outside forces, these attempts, too, are realizable only in the state of completeness, or that to which there are no outside forces.</p><p>Or that all these words are synonyms, all meaning the state that we call the positive state&#x2014;</p><p>That our whole &#x201c;existence&#x201d; is a striving for the positive state.</p><p>The amazing paradox of it all:</p><p>That all things are trying to become the universal by excluding other things.</p><p>That there is only this one process, and that it does animate all expressions, in all fields of phenomena, of that which we think of as one inter-continuous nexus:</p><p>The religious and their idea or ideal of the soul. They mean distinct, stable entity, or a state that is independent, and not a mere flux of vibrations or complex of reactions to environment, continuous with environment, merging away with an infinitude of other interdependent complexes.</p><p>But the only thing that would not merge away into something else would be that besides which there is nothing else.</p><p>That Truth is only another name for the positive state, or that the quest for Truth is the attempt to achieve positiveness:</p><p>Scientists who have thought that they were seeking Truth, but who were trying to find out astronomic, or chemic, or biologic truths. But Truth is that besides which there is nothing: nothing to modify it, nothing to question it, nothing to form an exception: the all-inclusive, the complete&#x2014;</p><p>By Truth I mean the Universal.</p><p>So chemists have sought the true, or the real, and have always failed in their endeavors, because of the outside relations of chemical phenomena: have failed in the sense that never has a chemical law, without exceptions, been discovered: because chemistry is continuous with astronomy, phys...</p></p><h2>Combinatorial Lottery Systems (Wheels) with Guaranteed Wins</h2><p>This is a book for players or groups of players, who want to <strong>play more than six numbers</strong> and more tickets in a well-organized, balanced, and entertaining way. The strategies outlined in the book can be used in <strong>any pick-6 lottery in the world</strong>. The author has used advanced methods of <strong>combinatorics and optimization</strong> to design the <strong>most economical lottery system (wheel)</strong> for any given guarantee. Each system in his book comes with a <strong>complete table of possible wins</strong>. The lottery player will find systems with <strong>double and multiple guarantees</strong>, excellent navigational tools and presentation. It is a common belief that the lottery is a boring game and the only excitement comes from watching the draw and matching some of the winning numbers. This book shows that choosing the right way of playing your numbers, assessing the possible wins and filling the tickets can be as entertaining as a trip to Las Vegas! Players who are interested in lotto systems for PICK-5 lotteries can check Dr. Bluskov's pick-5 book titled Combinatorial systems (wheels) with guaranteed wins for pick-5 lotteries including Euromillions and the Mega lotteries (also at Amazon).<p></p> <p></p></p><p>The author has worked as a freelance writer for a number of lottery publications in Europe and North America, and has spent many years in research in Combinatorics, a branch of Mathematics, which, among other things, deals with combinatorial lottery systems (or coverings, as they call them in Combinatorics). He holds several academic degrees, including Ph.D. in Mathematics, and works as a university professor. Dr. Bluskov has written over 20 research papers related to lotteries and over 200 publications on lottery systems. The objects presented in his book originate from the most recent research in the area, and are based on his expert knowledge of the subject.In this <strong>new, improved, and expanded edition of his PICK-6 book</strong>, Professor Bluskov again delivers the best lottery systems to the attention of lotto players from around the world. A total of 128 current <strong>world record least expensive systems</strong> for a broad range of guarantees are presented. This book offers the <strong>newest and best on lotto systems (wheels)</strong>. It is a book of interest to every lottery player or a group of players who wish to play their numbers in an <strong>organized and balanced way</strong>. Lottery systems (wheels) <strong>guarantee wins in the same way a single ticket does</strong> while allowing playing with many numbers (7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,... etc.) For instance, a single ticket guarantees a 4-win if four of the player's numbers are drawn. A <strong>lottery system</strong> is a well-organized set of tickets, giving the same guarantee, while allowing the players to use as many numbers as they wish. For example, system #24 from the book guarantees a 4-win whenever four of the player's 14 numbers are drawn; system #25 guarantees a 4-win whenever four of the player's 15 numbers are drawn, etc. Systems with many other guarantees are presented in this excellent strategy book. Each system has been constructed by Dr. Bluskov's new techniques of combinatorial and computer optimization, and, therefore, gives the most <strong>economical way</strong> of playing for a certain guaranteed win. All of these systems are <strong>world records</strong> in terms of performance (achieving certain guarantee in the minimum possible number of tickets). The book is the only one on the subject which is written by a mathematician and a lottery expert and we believe it is the best one in existence. The book offers a huge number of <strong>improvements</strong> in the area of classical lottery systems. Many features of the book are completely new for the genre, for example, systems with <strong>double and multiple guarantees</strong> and <strong>tables of possible wins</strong>. Other unique features include the presentation and organization of the material: Each system appears as a separate article, including a <strong>table of all possible wins</strong>; comments on various characteristics of the system, such as <strong>minimality, balance and density</strong>; and the system itself. The book provides the tools to make playing the lottery as entertaining as playing a table game and gives the player strategies to attack the jackpot in a balanced and well-organized way. No mathematical knowledge is needed to either play or understand the lottery systems, which makes the book accessible to virtually every lottery player or a group of players. --From the publisher</p><h2>Baby Penguins Everywhere!</h2><p>Can there be such a thing as too many adorable penguins?<br><br>One day a penguin sees a most unusual sight: a hat floating in the icy water.

During the summer before their seventh-grade year, Kristy, Mary Anne, Claudia, and Stacey tackle difficulties, including family problems, crushes, moving, and making new friends.</p><p>Before there was the Baby-Sitters Club, there were four girls named Kristy Thomas, Mary Anne Spier, Claudia Kishi, and Stacey McGill. As they start the summer before seventh grade (also before they start the BSC), each of them is on the cusp of a big change. Kristy is still hung up on hoping that her father will return to her family. Mary Anne has to prove to her father that she's no longer a little girl who needs hundreds of rules. Claudia is navigating her first major crush on a boy. And Stacey is leaving her entire New York City life behind... <p>...in order to find new friends in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. </p><p> </p><p>The Summer Before . . . is a sweet, moving novel about four girls on the edge of something big - not just the Club that will change their lives, but also all the joys and tribulations of being twelve and thirteen.</p><p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive Interview with Author Ann M. Martin</strong><br><br> <strong></strong><p><strong> Q:</strong> It's been a decade since the last Baby-sitters Club books came out, and 24 years since the first book was published. What was it like to come back to the BSC after so many years away?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I had a great time re-visiting the characters. It was fun to explore their lives in the prequel, &#x201c;"The Summer Before," and to figure out what led the girls to form The Baby-sitters Club, something that would eventually change their lives. It was like a reunion with friends--friends who haven&#x2019;t changed a bit. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, and Stacey are very different characters, which is in part why the series was and is still so popular. Every reader can relate to at least one of the characters. So, we have to ask you--which character are you most like?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I am most like Mary Anne who is the shy and quiet one. Like me, Mary Anne enjoys more solitary pursuits such as reading and needlework. My favorite character, however, is Kristy. I think she's my alter ego.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Were you allowed to baby-sit when you were twelve? If so, were they any funny or awful stories you'd like to share? <br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> Yes, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was twelve. One of the worst and also funniest things that ever happened was when I was baby-sitting for our neighbors and the kids wanted to wash their parents' car. They started the job with much enthusiasm--using Brillo pads. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> More than 200 BSC books were published in the eighties and nineties. Are there any that you are particularly fond of and why?<br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> My favorite Baby-sitters Club book is "Kristy's Great Idea," which is the first book and sets the series in motion. I also like the more serious books such as "Claudia and the Sad Good-bye," which deals with the death of Claudia&#x2019;s grandmother. This book was written shortly after my own grandmother died. My other favorite BSC books include &#x201c;Kristy and the Secret of Susan,&#x201d; in which the members of the BSC baby-sit for a child with autism, and "Jessi's Secret Language" in which the girls learn American Sign Language in order to communicate with a sitting charge with profound hearing impairment.<br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Why do you think that the series is so well-loved and has endured over so many years? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I think the characters in the BSC books are easily relatable. The books deal with timeless topics including friendship, family, and school.&nbsp; Also, the books tackle serious issues including racism, bullying, kids with disabilities (physical and mental), and death of a loved one. These issues were relevant to kids in the 1980s and 1990s, and are still relevant to kids today. In addition to being relatable, these are characters readers can aspire to. The kids run a business--in this case, a baby-sitting business. They are entrepreneurial, independent, creative, and confident. And at the heart of the series is the friendship--the "glue" that binds these characters. Sure, they have fights, but they're loyal and they support one another. I think a lot of us--even adults--can relate to that. <br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>"The Summer Before" takes place during the summer before the girls enter the seventh grade--where suddenly there's a ton of pressure to fit in. The months leading up to it can be filled with anxiety, excitement, and anticipation. Do you remember how you spent the summer before seventh grade? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I was nervous that summer because in the fall I would be going to a new school &#x2013; the junior high (this was in the time before middle schools). Even the words "junior high" seemed terribly grown-up. My friends and I would be attending school with eighth-graders, who were one step away from high school. I spent that summer reading, going to the community pool, taking a family trip to Cape May, New Jersey, doing some baby-sitting, and also recovering from surgery. But the knowledge that I would soon be in junior high school colored every day and every activity and did lend the summer an air of both anxiety and anticipation.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Despite the fun the girls have together in "The Summer Before," they're all dealing with pretty tough problems&#x2014;moving away, an absentee father, a first crush. How did you choose the issues you wanted to focus on?<br><br> <strong>Martin:&nbsp;</strong> One of my favorite things about writing a series was that the characters themselves generated plot ideas for later books. One of the themes that developed as the series progressed was that of Kristy's relationship with her father. It was an idea I enjoyed exploring, and when I had the opportunity to write the prequel I realized that this summer would be a charged time for Kristy, and that I could introduce the issues she had with her father here; then they could unfold in the later books. The same applied to Stacey. Her reasons for moving to Stoneybrook had been revealed in later books, but I realized that during this particular summer the reader could actually watch the events take place. The other issues &#x2013; a first crush, wanting more independence yet still feeling like a kid--are themes that I felt would resonate with most "tween" readers.<br><strong><br> Q: </strong>Even though the books have been out of print for ten years there are still some very devoted fans. Surely you must have received a ton of letters about the series over the years. Are there any that stick out in your mind?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> The most memorable are stories of girls who have written to me and told me that I&#x2019;ve made an impact on their lives, that The Baby-sitters Club books have turned them into readers. Some have also said that the BSC books made them aspire to become writers. I&#x2019;ve also heard from a lot of the original fans who grew up to become teachers, librarians, editors, journalists, entrepreneurs, etc. To know that this series inspired a generation of readers and writers is very humbling. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> There&#x2019;s been a lot of speculation in the blogosphere about where Claudia, Kristy, Mary Ann, and Stacey would be now, in 2010, had they grown up. Do you have any thoughts on what path each would have taken?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong>&nbsp; I understand the fascination of the older BSC fans who would like to know what happened with the characters when they got older. It&#x2019;s thrilling to realize that after all these years the fans remain passionate about the books and the characters in The Baby-sitters Club. I can see Kristy running a business--I can also see her being in politics. I think Mary Anne became a teacher. I imagine Stacey went into fashion--not as a designer, but maybe on the business side. And Claudia became an artist. I think fans can fill in for the rest of the characters!<br><br> </p>Ann M.

Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can&#39;t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it&#39;s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA&#39;s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth.</p><p></p><h2>New Poetry (Poets)</h2><p>Spine creased and faded, owner&#39;s inscription.

Tony Pashley revisits the path that he took in the Pashley Project articles in Race Tech magazine during the design and construction of two successful hillclimb cars. This time in great detail with a view to enabling the reader to carryout a similar exercise for themselves. Although hillclimb and sprint cars are the focal topic, a lot of the book is applicable to race cars in general. The cars under discussion in the book are powered by motor cycle engines which, in the smaller racing car classes are meeting with great success. The total process of building a car is described beginning with the selection and procurement of the engine. Chassis and suspension design is covered in a simplistic but adequate manner as the author's aim is to minimise the inclusion of involved calculations. Two recipes for chassis construction are illustrated in detail along with guidance on the processes of construction and a description of the required equipment. Following on from this the fabrication of the suspension is explained. Further chapters are dedicated to the remaining aspects of the vehicle covering; transmission, brakes, fuel and coolant systems and electrics. The book is heavily illustrated with 200 photographs and extensive explanatory diagrams and tables. This book is a vital addition to any would be kit car builders library.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Tony Pashley has been active in motorsports for almost fifty years, starting out in motorcycle scrambling in 1957 and subsequently being involved in both competing and developing machinery in various branches of the sport on two, three and four wheels. Initially trained as a toolmaker he subsequently worked on engine development in the aircraft industry before becoming a project engineer in the nuclear power industry. He has during the last twenty years been involved in speed hillclimbing, invariably driving racing cars of his own design and construction with considerable success.<br><br><b>Speedscene, July 2008</b><b><br> The magazine of the Hillclimb and Sprint association</b><br><br> As anyone who read his long-running series of articles in 'Race Tech' magazine will know, Marengo constructor Tony Pashley is as adept at conveying the technicalities of race car construction to the reader as he is at actually building the cars themselves. With the modern motorcycle engine now the power unit of choice for the majority of cars in the smaller &#x2013; and some in the larger &#x2013; capacity classes in hillclimbing, it&#x2019;s perhaps surprising that the modification and installation of bike engines for use in competition cars has rarely been covered in detail in any publication. So it&#x2019;s good that Veloce have entrusted to Tony the first book to be devoted entirely to the building of these cars. This is an essentially practical guide, covering all the basics of race car design and construction (of both tubular and honeycomb chassis) based on experience gained with Tony&#x2019;s three highly successful Marengo chassis. In any design process, other people&#x2019;s ideas provide not only inspiration but a valuable guide, and a useful feature of the book includes multiple examples of suspension construction, engine installations, damper layouts, exhaust and cooling systems and many more essential items laid out on one or more pages for instant comparison. Materials and hardware selection form another important part in the process and the author guides us through these and indeed all the myriad of other basic engineering techniques involved. An engineer is, he reminds us, someone who washes his hands before going to the toilet! &#x2013; an old saying perhaps, but just one example of Pashley&#x2019;s immensely readable style that provides an easy grasp of a complex subject. This, together with literally hundreds of diagrams and full colour illustrations, make this book an absolute &#x2018;must read&#x2019; for anyone contemplating such a project.<br><br><br><p>The Motor Cycling Club, September 2008<br> UK club newsletter<br> Circ: approx 1000<br><br> Having spent the summer of 1956 with a Cooper JAP, after which I never wished to see anything engined by something from a motorcycle again (although I broke that vow the following year when I raced an outboard hydroplane with a similar motor), my face was wreathed in a wry smile when I read this title. However, we should remember that modern motorcycles are powered by something much more sophisticated than the poor old speedway JAP with its total loss lubrication system, which liberally coated the driver with evil smelling castor-based oil, although in my case it fortunately never had the dire effects on my digestive system that my father suffered in WW1 when he had to sit for hours on end in an open cockpit breathing from a slipstream full of castor oil droplets. Apart from bringing back a few memories I enjoyed this book which is much wider in scope than its title suggests and indeed deals with most aspects of designing and building a special, certainly not confining itself to the whys and wherefores of modern motorcycle engines. Although looking specifically at something for the track much of the content would be of interest and helpful to any member who is contemplating a trials special or even modifying an existing car. It&#x2019;s not light reading although easy to follow and I suggest that once read it will frequently be taken from the bookcase for reference. Worth having.<br><br></p><p>teamdan.com, July 2008<br> http://www.teamdan.com/archive/2008/book_review/book_reviews.html<br><br> When this book landed on my doormat I opened it with much interest, as it isn&#x2019;t something I would normally read about. If I show the book to my wife I know that there will be a polite look of interest followed by a snort of derision at the idea of me building a car. I might have the spanner set, but they are still largely unscratched and unused in their original carry case, unsullied by grease and oil. But how hard can it be anyway &#x2013; I was exceedingly handy with a technical Lego set as a child! Reading the introduction entitled &#x201c;Health Warning&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t seem to me to be any different to my usual experiences. Mr. Pashley says &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll also have suffered the ridicule and contempt of family and acquaintances as you neglect all of the duties and pastimes of the &#x2018;real world&#x2019;, and maybe, just maybe, excite a few feelings of respect and even envy in the folk whose views you care about&#x201d;. It sounds as though building a motorcycle-engined race car is just like maintaining my website!<br><br> The book has certainly achieved one of its aims &#x2013; it has convinced me that I would be unable to do it. It takes you step by step through the entire construction process, highlighting all of the bits and pieces that you need to consider. However, to read the book it helps if you have some familiarity with metal working terminology &#x2013; especially as you will be expected to construct your own chassis, either from metal tubing on aluminum honeycomb. If you don&#x2019;t know how to weld you ought to buy a companion volume and practice first, and if using glues, you will need something stronger than Pritt Stick. The book is about proper engineering ...<br><br> Reading the book is like talking to a knowledgeable mate down the pub, helping you to avoid the pitfalls and giving you the benefit of the author's experience. What is also great are the diagrams in the book, helping to simplify what can be complex topics such as suspension. But the book is not the be all and end all on the subject, and it doesn&#x2019;t pretend to be. What it is is a good all round basic introduction to the subject and the issues involved, with pointers to where the budding builder can find out more information as and where needed. If you are thinking of perhaps building your own car, then buy and read this book before you start, and if you are still enthusiastic at the end of it, read the other books referenced. At the very least you will make a better informed decision, but as to whether it was the right one only time (and perhaps track results) will tell.</p><br><br><p><b>Track &amp; Race Cars magazine, October 2008</b><b><br> UK magazine<br> &nbsp;<br> TRC RECO</b><b>M</b><b>M</b><b>ENDS</b><br><br> This book is aimed primarily at hill-climb and sprint car and helps to build one from a budget. It begins with choosing the right engine and works through to design and construction. There is an extensive amount of pictures and diagrams, which does help as there is a lot to read and it breaks up the text well. It describes the subjects that will affect this kind of build in good detail and would be very helpful for people looking into this area. &nbsp;</p><p><b>British Racing News, December 2008</b><b><br> The magazine of the British Racing &amp; Sports Car Club<br> &nbsp;</b><br> Astoundingly comprehensive, well-written &#x2013; with nicely inserted humor &#x2013; it might be a soft-back, but this book is well worth 25 smackers. Even if the last thing you want to do is build a &#x2019;bike-engined racer. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you thought the process was just welding a few tubes together and slotting a breaker&#x2019;s yard &#x2019;bike screamer and &#x2019;box in there, then think again &#x2013; it is nothing of the sort. It is a major project, likely to daunt many, demanding determination to succeed and the most fastidious attention to detail.&nbsp; Pashley has those qualities, as proven in the past 20 years spent designing and building three &#x2019;bike-engined hill-climbers from scratch, at the time immersing himself in others&#x2019; similar projects. And the complete, honest way he approached that is evidently how he approached writing this book: it shines from every page.&nbsp; Mrs Pashley, the book&#x2019;s unpaid proof reader, has done a great job. She also &#x2018;gets&#x2019; hubby&#x2019;s subtle humor. Under &#x2018;C&#x2019; in the alphabetic glossary of suspension, steering and chassis terms, we find; &#x2018;&#x2018;C&#x2019; word, compromise. A device for by-passing impasses met frequently during the design and construction processes, normally determined whilst [sic] engrossed on unconnected activities such as sleeping or drinking.&#x2019;&nbsp; The reviewer is a qualified mechanical engineer with decades of motor sport engineering under his belt: I learned more from this book. In a way it is a worthy, more modern, yet more specific, companion to Terrapin guru Allan Staniforth&#x2019;s obligatory 'Race and Rally Car Sourcebook'; to which Pashey makes deferential reference within his pages. Informative and educational &#x2013; and fun to read. Who cares if it&#x2019;s a $50.00 &nbsp;paperback?

This interdisciplinary book offers a broader, richer picture of the first Christian families by drawing together research by experts ranging from archaeologists to ancient historians. / By exploring the nature of households in the ancient Greco-Roman world, the contributors assemble a new understanding of ancient Christian families that is both compelling and instructive. Divided into six parts, the book covers key aspects of ancient family life, from meals and child-rearing to women&#39;s roles and the lives of slaves. Three concluding chapters explore the implications of all this information for theological education today.</p><p>David L.

A gay son&#39;s troubled homage to his father, ONE HAND ON THE WHEEL is also the first book in the new California Poetry Series by Roundhouse Press a new imprint of Hayday Books. In a series of linked poems, a gay son at his father&#39;s deathbed (no accident/ it&#39;s me, Dad, your mortal enemy and friend . . . ) uncovers his family&#39;s past and his own passage from childhood to raising a son. Singular, fresh . . . [Dan Bellm] is an American artist of enormous gifts and discipline - June Jordan. Dan Bellm&#39;s courageous and human poems are a strong inauguration for the California Poetry Series. A very fine book - Adrienne Rich.</p><p>This lean, expressive debut (the first in the California Poetry Series, edited by Joyce Jenkins of <i>Poetry Flash</i>) is like a mournful cowboy song, neither giving too much nor holding back. Although Dan Bellm's subject is his father's love and the troubled precincts of American masculinity, his subtext is the silence between sons and fathers. His spare, formal lines manage both to reiterate his father's pained reticence and to challenge it. He reaches into an imagined past for the origins of his father's hardness; for his tender, uncertain proposal of marriage to Bellm's mother; and for his perennial self-doubt as a second son who will turn away emotionally from his own second son. While Bellm is capable of sustained lyricism, in most cases he has chosen the terse statement over the elaboration, in work as spare and direct as the opening lines from "Discipline": "What he had to teach I didn't want to learn / What I wanted to learn he was not the one to teach, / and we turned from each other with a graceless dismay, / heartsore, hurt-shy, trapped together in a family." <i>--Regina Marler</i>In a series of linked poems, a gay son at his father&#39;s deathbed (&#34;no accident/it&#39;s me, Dad, your mortal enemy and friend . . .&#34;) uncovers his family&#39;s past and his own passage from childhood to raising a son. Cool and alert, the poems stretch across roadways from Illinois to California and from the 1840&#39;s to the present, navigating the silences and reticent disclosures of generations of boys and men.</p><h2>Green Pharmacy: a History of Herbal Medicine</h2><p>An account of the knowledge and use of herbal medicines chronicles the continual conflict between herbalists and the medical establishment from the ancient Greeks and Romans to modern cancer research</p><p></p><h2>A Woman&#39;s Place: Yesterday&#39;s Women in Rural America</h2><p>An evocative portrait of women in rural America during the era after the Civil War, documenting three decades of social change and a period of history often neglected.</p><p>The period between the Civil War and the turn of the century was a time of great social upheaval in the United States. Lured by the promises of industrialization, much of the rural population moved to the cities, but those who remained in the countryside were isolated from the rapid changes in American society. Women found themselves torn between the battle for women&#39;s rights being hotly debated in the cities and the traditional role of homemaker, mother, and helper that was the norm in rural areas. In A Woman&#39;s Place, Norton Juster brings this turbulent period of American history to life using a broad sampling of articles, letters, poems, and essays taken from the popular literature of the time. While these publications recognized the hardship that characterized the lives of their readers, they upheld the idealized vision of the farmer&#39;s wife. It is this historical conflict between the independent woman and the traditional female role that makes A Woman&#39;s Place important reading today.Norton Juster is a practicing architect and professor of environmental design at Hampshire College. He is the author of a number of books, including The Phantom Tollbooth, The Dot and the Line and Alberic the Wise. He lives with his wife in a small rural community in western Massachusetts.</p><h2>112 Meditations for Self Realization: Vigyan Bhairava Tantra</h2><p>The Vigyan Bhairava Tantra is one of yoga&#39;s most important texts.

Reissue.</p><p>On a Fourth of July picnic with his human family, McDuff, a beloved but trouble-mongering white terrier, inadvertently allows "silent invaders" (namely, ants) to make off with the entire contents of the lunch basket. Luckily, McDuff has a way with strangers (and their picnic baskets), and in no time flat, he's finagled an invitation from a lonely older man to share his meal with the family.<p> Rosemary Wells and Susan Jeffers's series about the earnest pooch and his expanding community of friends and family harkens back to quainter days, when baby carriers were buckled into cars with leather straps and kind gentlemen didn't mind sharing their fried chicken and devil's food cake with strangers. Jeffers's inviting paintings of 1930s cars and fashions, and of course the little white dog himself, are warm and appealing. Readers who loved <i>McDuff Goes to School</i> and <i>McDuff's New Friend</i> will enjoy this summery entry in the series. (Ages 3 to 5) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>PreSchool-Grade 2-The sweet, furry pup is back again in a slightly longer tale. Fred, Lucy, their baby, and McDuff are going on a Fourth of July outing and the car is full-to-overflowing with baby gear and picnic paraphernalia. After stopping twice, once to walk and water the dog and again to feed the child, they finally reach Lake Ocarina. McDuff is put in charge of guarding the picnic basket while Lucy and Fred unload the car. When ants carry off their provisions, the West Highland terrier goes in search of food and discovers Mr. DiMaggio's meatballs. The older gentleman shares his picnic with the young family so no one is hungry and no one is lonely. When Mr. DiMaggio plays "The Star-Spangled Banner" on his concertina, the baby's wails and McDuff's howls signal the end of the celebration. Jeffers's humorous illustrations-sometimes four to a page-reveal the day in detail and depict the summer holiday with an old-fashioned flavor. The dog's various expressions are perfectly represented, showing his contentment, surprise, determination, hunger, dismay, and satisfaction. The text will strike a chord with parents who understand all the work that traveling with a young child entails, and youngsters will be pleased to see that this lovable canine has returned.<br><i>Maryann H.

The first section contains statistical analysis of current beliefs and attitudes toward religion and the church (some very surprising) as indicated in polls of members of this age group. The second section delves deeper into these attitudes with results from focused interviews. The authors develop some broad themes, backed up by statistics from the first section.

And then, both of them stopped. &#x201c;The synagogue!&#x201d; Elder Thomas said. It had never occurred to him that anyone &#x2013; even the Nazis &#x2013; would do such a thing. Elder Thomas got his camera out. He snapped the shot but then heard someone say, in German, &#x201c;What are you doing there?&#x201d; He tucked the camera inside his coat, under his arm. He tried to appear normal, but his heart was suddenly beating hard. A man was crossing the narrow street and coming toward them. &#x201c;Making pictures?&#x201d; the man asked as he walked closer. Elder Thomas took a better look. He saw what he feared: the black uniform with silver trim and braided hat. Gestapo. Elder Alex Thomas wants only to teach the gospel to the people of Germany. But it soon becomes obvious that he will never complete his mission. War is coming, and that will affect not only Elder Thomas but also his family back home in Salt Lake City. In the family is Wally, Elder Thomas&#x2019;s younger brother, who usually just wants ot have a good time, but lately doesn&#x2019;t seem to care much about anything. There&#x2019;s his sister Bobbi, who is supposed to marry Phil Clark, the most eligible bachelor in the Salt Lake Valley. The problem is, she can&#x2019;t ignore her attraction to Dr. Stinson, a University of Utah professor who&#x2019;s not a member of the Church. And there are Elder Thomas&#x2019;s parents, D. Alexander Thomas, stake president and his wife, Bea, who want their children to be true to the values and ideals they&#x2019;ve taught them. But President and Sister Thomas are finding they can&#x2019;t just tell their children what to do anymore, and they&#x2019;re worried about what will happen when the United States enters a war that no one seems able to stop. In Rumors of War, the first volume of the series Children of the Promise, author Dean Hughes recreates the era of World War II in stunning detail. But more than that, he shows how the war affects an ordinary family of Latter-day Saints. If you&#x2019;re interested in Church or world history, or if you&#x2019;re simply looking for a powerful LDS novel, you won&#x2019;t want to miss Rumors of War.</p><p>Dean Hughes has published more than ninety books, including many national titles, as well as the popular Children of the Promise and Hearts of the Children series from Deseret Book.

When in the hell are you gonna get that straight, Bubbles?&#x201d;</p><p>My eyelids flew open in a flash and I found myself staring into a fleshy, white shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Aaaagh,&#x201d; I screamed. My hands squeezed what they had been gripping under the covers. Not muscle. Flab. Mounds and mounds of gut.</p><p>&#x201c;Oww, stop that. You&#x2019;re hurting me.&#x201d;</p><p>I bolted upright, pulling the sheets tightly around me. &#x201c;Oh . . . my . . . God.&#x201d;</p><p>Dan the Man, my fat, adulterous, ambulance-chasing lawyer of an ex-husband, lay next to me in bed, arms behind his head, a scowl on his face.</p><p>&#x201c;No one calls me Dan anymore,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Everyone calls me Chip. All except you and those buffoons down at Legal Aid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Steve?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Steve? You mean that punk photographer? How in the bejeezus am I supposed to know?&#x201d;</p><p>Stiletto&#x2019;s return from overseas must have been a dream. My stomach felt weak and nauseous. I was afraid I&#x2019;d throw up, maybe. And a headache. Oh, such a headache, like I&#x2019;d been crowned by an anvil.</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to be sick,&#x201d; I croaked.</p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised considering the condition you came in last night, Bubbles.&#x201d; Dan threw back the covers, revealing his blubbery belly and a pair of ripped, yellow-striped boxer shorts. &#x201c;Boy, were you sloshed. You passed out here, right on the convertible couch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was not sloshed,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;I was just very, very tired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. And as a former Lehigh University frat boy I don&#x2019;t know from tanked.&#x201d; Dan snorted as he made his way to the bathroom. &#x201c;Getting blotto was my major. I graduated summa cum laude in alcohol overload.&#x201d;</p><p>Could Dan have been right? Could I, Bubbles Yablonsky, thirty-four-year-old single mother, hairdresser, aspiring investigative journalist and one of the few living Polish-Lithuanian Barbie dolls in Lehigh, Pennsylvania, have allowed myself to get, gasp, tipsy?</p><p>No. I never touch alcohol. It tastes gross and . . .</p><p>I dropped the sheet. I was still wearing my spiffy fire-engine-red sequined dress, now wrinkled and reeking of cigarette smoke. My black hose were bunched at the ankles and a gigantic run exposed my big toe.</p><p>Ohhh. I collapsed in a heap of self loathing, painfully recalling how I&#x2019;d spent the night before at the bachelorette party for Lehigh Police Department records clerk Janice Kramer, fianc�e of Detective Mickey Sinkler and my best source for sealed search warrants.</p><p>It was those darn strawberry-kiwi Jell-O shots Janice&#x2019;s coworkers at the police department brought to the party. They must&#x2019;ve been spiked.</p><p>I winced at the memory of me howling Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x2019;s &#x201c;Free Bird&#x201d; into the karaoke machine at Uncle Manny&#x2019;s Bar and Grille, which had opened on a Sunday night just to host our festivities. Janice had covered her mouth first in shock and then in delight when I jumped onto the pool table to play air guitar while the other partygoers whooped and cheered. Only Manny had remained glum, his eyes glaring at my spiked heels digging into the green felt.</p><p>To top it off I had evidently teetered home and passed out next to my ex, Dan the Man, who at the insistence of our daughter, Jane had been sleeping on our pull-out couch ever since his socialite wife Wendy had given him the heave-ho two weeks ago. Of this I was certain, however: while I had slept with Dan, I had not slept with Dan. A bug trap full of Spanish flies couldn&#x2019;t make me do that.</p><p>What I needed was sleep, a tall glass of ginger ale, two aspirin and a hot shower with plenty of Ivory soap. But mostly sleep. I closed my eyes and drifted off.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, aren&#x2019;t you supposed to be getting ready for that wedding?&#x201d; Dan was suited up for his Legal Aid job and munching on a hoagie. &#x201c;I thought by the time I returned for lunch you&#x2019;d be long gone. It&#x2019;s eleven-thirty.&#x201d;</p><p>Mickey and Janice&#x2019;s wedding. It was supposed to be at noon. And I was the maid of honor!</p><p>&#x201c;How long did I sleep?&#x201d;</p><p>Dan checked his watch. &#x201c;About four hours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you wake me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do I look like? Your personal valet?&#x201d;</p><p>I leapt out of bed. Here I was, unwashed and hungover, lazing about while Mickey&#x2019;s sweet bride, a kind and shy woman who had trusted me to lead her down the aisle, was probably pacing the narthex in frantic worry. Ugh.</p><p>I pushed Dan aside and scrambled up the stairs to the bathroom. Usually a Bubbles Deluxe took a good forty-five minutes if my Sunshine Blonde Number Eight locks were to be teased and sprayed into an indestructible beehive. Eyebrow penciling alone could eat up five. I had, what, ten minutes tops to shower and change into a Bo Peep bridesmaid&#x2019;s outfit complete with hoopskirt, bonnet and satin-covered staff.</p><p>There was no way I could get to the church in time. At best, I&#x2019;d arrive right when Mickey and Janice were exchanging vows.</p><p>But I needn&#x2019;t have rushed.</p><p>For as I was soon to discover, there would be no blushing bride and beaming groom emerging from St. Lenny&#x2019;s South Side Catholic Church. No dollar dance at Walp&#x2019;s and fancy smorgasbord. No four-night, three-day honeymoon in the Pocono Mountains sipping sparkling wine by a Hotel Paupack heart-shaped bathtub.</p><p>There would be no wedding. Only murder.</p><p>Looking back, I blame the Skynyrd.</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Marvel Masterworks Presents the X-Men: Giant-size X-Men, No. 1 and X-Men, No. 94-100</h2><p>The X-Men with their mutant powers battle a host of deadly enemies.</p><p></p><h2>Living on Fire: The Life of L. Brent Bozell Jr.</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;A triumph&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A moving, beautifully written biography&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<i>National Review</i></b></p><p> From the beginning, L. Brent Bozell seemed destined for great things.</p><p> An extraordinary orator, the young man with fiery red hair won a national debate competition in high school and later was elected president of Yale&#x2019;s storied Political Union, where his debating partner was his close friend William F. Buckley Jr. In less than a decade after graduating from Yale, Bozell helped Buckley launch <i>National Review</i>, became a popular columnist and speaker, and, most famously, wrote Barry Goldwater&#x2019;s landmark book <i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i>.</p><p> But after setting his sights on high political office, Bozell took a different route in the 1960s. He abruptly moved his family to Spain; he founded a traditional Catholic magazine, <i>Triumph</i>, that quickly turned radical; he repudiated on religious grounds the U.S. Constitution; he made it his mission to transform America into a Catholic nation; he led the nation&#x2019;s major antiabortion protest (featuring a militant group known as the Sons of Thunder); he severed ties with his erstwhile friends from the conservative movement, including Buckley (who was also his brother-in-law). By the mid-1970s, Bozell had fallen prey to bipolar disorder and alcoholism, leading life as if &#x201c;manacled to a roller coaster,&#x201d; as a friend put it.</p><p> Biographer Daniel Kelly tells Bozell&#x2019;s remarkable story vividly and with sensitivity in <b><i>Living on Fire</i></b>. To write this book, Kelly interviewed dozens of friends and family members and gained unprecedented access to Bozell&#x2019;s private correspondence. The result is a richly textured portrait of a gifted, complex man&#x2015;his triumphs as well as his struggles.</p><p> Once destined for Capitol Hill, L. Brent Bozell wound up working in Washington soup kitchens just blocks away. Bringing mercy to the poor became his vocation&#x2015;and, as <b><i>Living on Fire</i></b> shows, he succeeded admirably by the standards he came to embrace.</p></p><p><p><b>Daniel Kelly</b> (1938&#x2013;2012) was the author of <i>James Burnham and the Struggle for the World</i>, a life of L.

The mother is on her way to intensive care. Scorcher Kennedy is given the case because he is the Murder squad&#39;s star detective. At first he and his rookie partner, Richie, think this is a simple one: Pat Spain was a casualty of the recession, so he killed his children, tried to kill his wife Jenny, and finished off with himself. But there are too many inexplicable details and the evidence is pointing in two directions at once. Scorcher&#39;s personal life is tugging for his attention. Seeing the case on the news has sent his sister Dina off the rails again, and she&#39;s resurrecting something that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control: what happened to their family, one summer at Broken Harbour, back when they were children. The neat compartments of his life are breaking down, and the sudden tangle of work and family is putting both at risk ...</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2012</strong>: In Tana French&#x2019;s fourth novel, detective Mick "Scorcher" Kennedy and his partner are sent to the abandoned, half-constructed housing development <i>Broken Harbor</i> to investigate the brutal murder of the Spain family. What Scorcher thinks is an open and shut case is quickly complicated when Jenny Spain is found barely alive, and the family&#x2019;s circumstances are brought to light: hidden baby monitors, a strained mortgage brought on by the housing crisis, and the increasingly erratic signs of a family in crisis. French fans will appreciate this new look at Scorcher, who was a minor character in <i>Faithful Place</i>; he shines as the successful but jaded detective with a troubled past. French delivers a layered psychological thriller and satisfying &#x2018;who dunnit,&#x2019; masterfully spinning a plot packed with tension and a haunting mood that rivals the best of the gothic writers. <em>--Heather Dileepan</em><br>Tana French grew up in Ireland, Italy, the United States and Malawi.

His intelligence collection results have never been surpassed and rarely equaled. Among his achievements:<br></p><p>He described the interior of a top-secret Soviet manufacturing plant and accurately predicted a new class of submarine under construction there.</p><p>He sketched the location and described the thoughts of a kidnapped U.S. Army General being held by the Red Brigade in Northern Italy.</p><p>Nearly a year in advance he accurately predicted when Skylab would leave orbit and where it would impact on the Earth&#x2019;s surface.</p><p>After conventional reconnaissance failed, he and others were able to locate a downed Soviet bomber that had been carrying nuclear materials.</p><p>He achieved these results using scientifically designed and tested double-blind protocols. And in the years since his retirement he has continued to demonstrate these abilities on camera for national television in three countries, in the lab at the famed Monroe Institute, and for private companies.</p><p>Are his abilities a natural gift, or taught? Was it his largely unsuspected psychic ability that helped keep him alive in Vietnam, and aided in his invaluable contributions to the cold war effort, that made McMoneagle a first-class remote viewer? How much did he owe to his near-death experience in the 1970s? And why would he give up a safe and distinguished career as an advisor to the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command to become Remote Viewer 001? This is his story.</p></p><p>This book incites curiosity...a deep, intuitive feeling after reading the book.

But with his memory damaged, the police hounding him, and no way even to get home, Paul&#x2019;s facing steep odds &#x2013; and a bleak fate if he fails...<br><br> This final, never-before-published novel by three-time Edgar Award winner Donald E. Westlake is a noir masterpiece, a dark and painful portrait of a man&#x2019;s struggle against merciless forces that threaten to strip him of his very identity.</p><p><b>Donald E. Westlake</b> is widely regarded as one of the great crime writers of the 20th Century. He won three Edgar Awards and was named a Grandmaster by the Mystery Writers of America.&nbsp; Many of his books have been made into movies; Westlake also wrote the screenplay for "The Grifters," for which he received an Academy Award nomination.*Starred Review* While on tour, actor Paul Cole is caught in flagrante delicto with another man&#x2019;s wife. The other man beats Paul into unconsciousness, and when he awakes in a hospital bed, he can&#x2019;t remember where he is or what happened to him. Can a man whose memory is irretrievably shattered hope to rebuild his life? This previously unpublished novel was written early in Westlake&#x2019;s career, and it feels that way: it&#x2019;s written in the crisp, unadorned style of The Mercenaries, Killing Time, and 361, all of which were published in the early 1960s. Unlike most of Westlake&#x2019;s books, Memory isn&#x2019;t really a crime novel; it&#x2019;s a psychological drama, the story of a man trying to find his way back to his own life. Westlake&#x2019;s fans will note the author&#x2019;s typically careful use of description and dialogue, but they may also be a bit stymied by his central character: Cole thinks of himself at one point as a steel marble in a pinball game . . . always in motion, and that seems just right for a man bouncing from moment to moment, reacting to events but never taking control of them. Compared to a typical Westlake protagonist, Paul Cole feels weak and ineffectual&#x2014;likable but a bit pathetic. But this is no typical Westlake novel; in fact, in many ways it&#x2019;s one of his most interesting books, simply because it&#x2019;s so very different. For his fans, absolutely a must-read. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People</h2><p>This book &#34;concentrates principally on historic Abyssinia and the culture of its Semitized peoples, and begins with a chapter on the history of the exploration of Ethiopia and of Ethiopian studies.

America&#39;s premier living author of short fiction, Bradbury has spent many lifetimes in this remarkable place--strolling through empty, shadow-washed fields at midnight; exploring long-forgotten rooms gathering dust behind doors bolted years ago to keep strangers locked out.. and secrets locked in. The nights are longer in this country. The cold hours of darkness move like autumn mists deeper and deeper toward winter. But the moonlight reveals great magic here--and a breathtaking vista. The October Country is many places: a picturesque Mexican village where death is a tourist attraction; a city beneath the city where drowned lovers are silently reunited; a carnival midway where a tiny man&#39;s most cherished fantasy can be fulfilled night after night. The October Country&#39;s inhabitants live, dream, work, die--and sometimes live again--discovering, often too late, the high price of citizenship. Here a glass jar can hold memories and nightmares; a woman&#39;s newborn child can plot murder; and a man&#39;s skeleton can war against him. Here there is no escaping the dark stranger who lives upstairs...or the reaper who wields the world. Each of these stories is a wonder, imagined by an acclaimed tale-teller writing from a place shadows. But there is astonishing beauty in these shadows, born from a prose that enchants and enthralls. Ray Bradbury&#39;s The October Country is a land of metaphors that can chill like a long-after-midnight wind...as they lift the reader high above a sleeping Earth on the strange wings of Uncle Einar.</p><p>Ray Bradbury&#39;s first short story collection is back in print, its chilling encounters with funhouse mirrors, parasitic accident-watchers, and strange poker chips intact. Both sides of Bradbury&#39;s vaunted childhood nostalgia are also on display, in the celebratory &#34;Uncle Einar,&#34; and haunting &#34;The Lake,&#34; the latter a fine elegy to childhood loss. This edition features a new introduction by Bradbury, an invaluable essay on writing, wherein the author tells of his &#34;Theater of Morning Voices,&#34; and, by inference, encourages you to listen to the same murmurings in yourself.

Stackpole is the author of the New York Times bestselling Star Wars X-wing novels. Dark Tide: Onslaught is the first of two new Star Wars novels he is writing.

He lives in Arizona with Liz Danforth and a small pack of Welsh Cardigan Corgis.CHAPTER TWO<br> <br>Snug in the X-wing simulator cockpit, Colonel Gavin Darklighter, Rogue Squadron's commanding officer, flicked his right thumb against the ring he wore on that hand. Apprehension gripped him, but he knew there was no sense in stalling a second longer. He glanced over his shoulder at the R2-Delta astromech droid sitting behind him. "Okay, Catch, run the simulation designated 'skipchaser.'"<br><br>The little gold-and-white droid tootled pleasantly, and the simulator cockpit came alive with lights and data scrolling on the primary screen. Despite the years of refits the little droid had undergone in Gavin's service--including requisite memory wipes and programming upgrades--it always greeted him with a brief summary of the weather on Tatooine and Coruscant. Gavin appreciated that little bit of pleasantry, which is why he'd not traded the droid in for a newer model--though the Delta upgrade had been most welcome for speeding up navigational computations.<br><br>The biggest change in his relationship with the droid had been its name. In the early days he'd called it Jawaswag, figuring that any Jawa would love to have the droid. Later, after the Thrawn crisis, a group of Jawas had tried to steal Jawaswag, but the droid had fended them off and actually hurt one. From that point forward Gavin had taken to calling the droid Toughcatch, which had just become shortened to Catch.<br><br>The simulator's visual field filled with stars and then an asteroid belt, into which Gavin guided the X-wing. It felt much like the old T-65s Rogue Squadron used to fly when he'd first joined the Rebellion, but the T-65A3 model was a couple of generations advanced over the original models. While not as slick as the new XJ model, the A3 had improved shields and lasers that boasted improvements in accuracy and power. The peace reached with the Imperial Remnant meant that there were few competent foes to test the new fighters against--and the fighter had proved quite lethal when unleashed on pirates in the Rimward regions of the New Republic.<br><br>Gavin glanced at his primary monitor, but nothing was popping up as a threat. He punched up a supplemental data plug-in that expanded the available target profiles. "Catch, give me biologicals down to the size of mynocks and anything that appears to be moving erratically or on a course that is beyond norm for orbital debris."<br><br>The droid whistled an acknowledgment, but still nothing showed on Gavin's screen. He frowned. What is it I'm supposed to be seeing? It makes no sense for Admiral Kre'fey to have given me access to this simulation if there is nothing out here.<br>Gavin hesitated for a moment. He knew that his idea of what made sense and a Bothan admiral's idea of same could be vastly different. Many times he'd had to deal with Bothan manipulation of himself or his command, and most of those times had been a disaster. Yet, despite the Kre'fey clan having a negative association with Rogue Squadron because of events over two decades old, Gavin had found young Traest Kre'fey to be remarkably straightforward in general, and very much more so when dealing with the Rogues.<br><br>The primary console beeped, and a small box appeared around a distant object on the X-wing's heads-up display. Gavin selected the object as a target and glanced down at its profile and image on the secondary monitor. At a quick glance it could have been mistaken for an asteroid and dismissed easily, but to Gavin it looked far too symmetrical. It reminded him a great deal of a seed--a bit bulbous in the middle, but tapered at both ends. The rear had a couple of recesses in it that could have hidden propulsion exhaust units, and a couple more up front that could house weapons.<br><br>Gavin shivered, then nudged the X-wing's throttle forward. "Catch, start recording this run. I want to be able to study the playback." Applying a little etheric rudder, Gavin pointed the X-wing's nose on a course that would cut behind the seed. Reaching up to his right, he flipped a switch that locked the S-foils in attack position. With a flick of his thumb, he shifted his weapons control to lasers and quadded them up so all four would fire with a single squeeze of the stick's trigger.<br><br>The seed shifted itself around so its nose swung into line with his approach vector. Sensors gave him no read on energy weapons powering up, which disturbed him less than getting no power readings for propulsion. How is that thing moving?<br>Before any answers suggested themselves, Gavin quickly kicked the X-wing into a barrel roll to starboard and leveled out with his crosshairs covering the seed. He triggered a quick blast and waited for the seed to explode, but that didn't happen. As the quad burst neared the target, the bolts all whirled into an invisible vortex and vanished into a pinpoint of white light.Emperor's black bones ...<br><br>The seed jetted forward, swinging around to bring its nose to bear on the X-wing. Gavin started to roll port and dive, but something shook his ship. In a heartbeat Catch started screeching and the X-wing's forward shields collapsed. Something dully red blossomed on the seed's nose, then shot toward the X-wing. It hit hard and splattered a bit, then what appeared to be molten rock started melting through the fighter's metal flesh.<br><br>Warning sirens blared, drowning out Catch's panicky tones. Bright red damage flags began to scroll up over the primary monitor, all but one of them moving too fast for Gavin to read. The one he could see reported a premature ignition of a proton torpedo's engine, which lit up the whole port magazine and tore the X-wing apart.<br><br>Stunned, Gavin sat back in his seat as the screens went black and the cockpit's hatch cracked open. He glanced at his chronometer and shook his head. "Catch, we lasted twenty-five seconds. What was that thing?"<br><br>A human orderly appeared at the edge of the cockpit. "Colonel Darklighter, the admiral sends his compliments."<br><br>Gavin blinked and stroked a gloved hand over his brown goatee. "His compliments? I lasted less than half a minute."<br><br>"Yes, Colonel, very true." The orderly smiled. "The admiral said he would meet you in your office in an hour and explain why you are to be congratulated on doing so well."<br>Gavin sat behind his desk, idly punching up holographic images on his holoprojector plate. The first picture showed him and his two sons--orphaned boys who had lived near the Rogue Squadron hangar after the Thrawn crisis--all smiles. The next showed the boys two years older, still smiling despite being all dressed up, standing with Gavin and his bride, Sera Faleur.<br><br>She'd been the social worker who had helped him through the adoption process for the boys. Gavin smiled as he remembered squadron mates telling him that their mixed marriage couldn't last. They were both human, but she came from Chandrila, having grown up on the shores of the Silver Sea, and he was from Tatooine, yet despite the differences in their homeworlds, they easily made a life together.<br>The next image showed Sera and Gavin with their first daughter; after that came shots of them with their new son and then another daughter. An image made as a New Year's greeting card showed all seven of them together. Gavin easily remembered how happy they'd all been together. Prior to meeting Sera he'd pretty much resigned himself to never finding someone to love, but she'd been the balm to heal his broken heart. She'd not made him forget the past and the lover he'd lost, she'd just helped him recapture the joy of life and all its possibilities.<br><br>"I hope I'm not interrupting anything, Colonel."<br><br>Gavin looked up through the image of his family and shook his head. "No, Admiral, not at all." He shut off the holoprojector, relieved that the Bothan admiral's arrival had stopped the cycle of pictures right there, at the happy times.<br>Admiral Traest Kre'fey bore a striking resemblance to the other members of the Kre'fey family Gavin had seen: the late General Laryn--the admiral's grandfather--and the admiral's brother, Karka. Despite having spent a certain amount of time in the company of Bothans, Gavin couldn't remember any outside the Kre'fey family whose fur was pure white. Traest didn't have the golden eyes the other two had; instead his were mostly violet with flecks of gold. Gavin assumed the violet came from Borsk Fey'lya's line, since he knew the two of them were related through some complicated tangle of marriages between the two families.<br><br>Traest wore a black flight suit that he'd unzipped down to midchest. He closed the door to Gavin's office, then unceremoniously plopped himself down on the couch to the left of the door. Gavin moved from behind his desk to one of the two chairs making up the conversation nook in his office.<br><br>He sat and rested his elbows on his knees. "It killed me in twenty-five seconds. What was it?"<br><br>The Bothan smiled. "Congratulations. I died in fifteen in my first engagement. Pulling the biological targeting data on-line is what gave you some warning."<br>"If I weren't dead, I'm sure that would make me feel better." Gavin frowned. "Do we know what it was?"<br><br>The Bothan admiral raked claws back through his pale mane. "Two days ago Leia Organa Solo spoke to the senate and tried to warn them about an unknown alien force that had attacked several worlds on the Rim, out beyond Dantooine. She didn't get a very warm reception. She left data behind, from which the simulation was created."<br><br>Gavin sat back in his chair. "You're telling me that seed, that 'thing,' is a starfighter being used by folks who attacked the Outer Rim?"<br><br>"Yes. Technically it's called a coralskipper by the species that created it. They grow them out of something called yorick coral. I know the name is not terribly inspiring of fear, but I assume it loses something in the translation from their tongue. I've designated them 'skips' for our purposes."<br><br>"And the pri...</p><h2>Runaway (Florida Civil War (Paperback))</h2><p><b><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Heather Graham recreates the tumultuous history of America&#x2019;s least-known frontier, Florida, in a love story that burns with passion and truth.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;I accepted you as payment on a gambling table because you&#x2019;re incredibly beautiful.

Not that he could see much of her at first.<br> &nbsp;<br> A sweeping, hooded black cape encompassed her from head to toe. He was only certain that it was a woman who had arrived because of the graceful twirl of her body when the master of the establishment, Harold Eastwood, accosted her at the doorway. A new serving maid? Had she joined the ranks of the lovely and available ladies of the New Orleans nights? Was she late reporting for work? Jarrett wondered, and he found himself intrigued, waiting for her to cast off the cloak. If she was working here at Eastwood&#x2019;s fine dining establishment and parlor, then the class of the place was improving.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that Eastwood&#x2019;s was a total den of iniquity. For a waterfront tavern it could boast being a respectable one. Most men came here when conducting business in this part of Louisiana, and most of them told their wives about the place. There was always good food to be had, pretty girls to sing tunes at the spinet, liquor from around the world, a woman if you wanted one, and now and then a good fight to choose a side for. The place was situated dead center in the port city of New Orleans, right on the river, and all manner of men and women came here, worked here, traded here, schemed here.<br> &nbsp;<br> New Orleans was a city Jarrett enjoyed. Established in 1718 by the French, it had grown later in the eighteenth century with the Acadian exodus from the northeast. It had passed to Spanish rule and then back to France before Thomas Jefferson had set forth to find a way to make Napoleon willing to accept his offer on the Louisiana Purchase. Jarrett had come here first as little more than a boy himself when Andrew Jackson had commanded the defense of the city against the British in 1815, and since that time Jarrett had felt a fondness for it. He liked the narrow streets of the riverfront, the charming architecture: French, Spanish, and American. He liked the wrought-iron balconies, the small gardens, the rolling Mississippi, and the lusty quality of life along the river. He had come to Eastwood&#x2019;s often enough, and though it had a dubious reputation, there were far more debauched places than this along the riverfront. All in all this was quite a respectable place when compared with some of the other establishments it neighbored.<br> &nbsp;<br> But from his very first sight of the woman enveloped in the black cape, Jarrett was convinced she didn&#x2019;t belong here.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I fold,&#x201d; Robert Treat, his friend and associate sitting to his left, said with a sigh. Robert threw his cards down on the oak playing table.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett stared at his own hand. Three queens. Two fours. Full house. He looked at the bills and gold pieces on the table. Smiling Jack, the rich Creole from the bayou country, sat across from him with a broad grin on his face. Hell. The man might be able to bluff Saint Peter if he ever made it to the pearly gates.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett took the time to drop a five-dollar gold piece on the table, then looked over the top of his cards again, watching the woman in the encompassing cape. She was still trying to explain something to Eastwood, a little potbellied man. She was slim and lithe, at least an inch or so taller than Eastwood. Jarrett wondered with some amusement if the innkeeper, whoremaster&#x2014;entrepreneur, as he liked to call himself&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t feel just a little bit intimidated by the woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rupert Furstenburg, the lean blond German from St. Louis, threw a wad of money down. &#x201c;I raise you, gentlemen. A hundred dollars.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Damned good thing I&#x2019;ve folded!&#x201d; Robert muttered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A hundred?&#x201d; Smiling Jack offered the German a broad smile. &#x201c;Pocket change. I&#x2019;ll see you, sir!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett was still watching the woman. Robert Treat gave him a nudge. &#x201c;A hundred, Jarrett.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said absently. He curled his fingers around the stack of coins in front of him, pushing out the correct amount. Robert Treat stared at him with a frown, lowering his voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you paying any attention to this game?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, is that the question?&#x201d; Smiling Jack, twirling his dark mustache, taunted lightly. &#x201c;Is that plantation of yours down in the swamp doing well enough for this game?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My swamp plantation is doing just as well as that place of yours out in the bayou,&#x201d; Jarrett said lazily. His cards were good enough. And his plantation was sure as hell doing well enough to support this game.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, mais oui!&#x201d; Jack murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve both the swamp, eh? The insects, the gators.&#x201d; He wagged a warning finger at Jarrett. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve got the Seminoles. What grows on my land is mine. My house has stood seventy years. And yours, mon ami? Poof! Even now the fellows may be sending it up in a cloud of smoke! You were a military man, so I&#x2019;ve heard. You must know. They slip in, the Indians, they slip out. They move through the night like wraiths. They can move through the thickest brush and trees. There will be more trouble, you mark my words. Old Andy Jackson fought those savages good back in sixteen and seventeen, but he didn&#x2019;t get them all. There will be trouble again. It&#x2019;s brewing hot and hard right now. Some say those renegades even ride the alligators through the swamp.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jarrett smiled at the Frenchman&#x2019;s vivid description, even if his smile was somewhat forced. He&#x2019;d yet to see any man, even a Seminole, riding a gator through the swamp! Jack&#x2019;s attitude was a fairly common one. People had the damned strangest way of looking at the Florida peninsula&#x2014;and the Florida Indians. Any of the Upper and Lower Creeks who had moved south, speaking varied languages and coming from very different peoples, were grouped together. They were called Seminoles. Some said the name meant runaway. Others said that it came from the Spanish word for renegade, cimarr�n. Runaways, renegades. Jarrett knew that just like him and so many white dreamers, the Indians were just seeking a better life for themselves and their families.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a land for dreamers. Despite the summer heat, the abundance of swampland, and the infestation of snakes&#x2014;and Indians&#x2014;there were huge land tracts available in the state. Like the western frontiers opening up across the continent, Florida was a raw, new land for Americans. Much of it was exceptionally fine farmland. Crops could sometimes be grown year round. Vicious freezes came upon occasion in the northern part of the territory, and the summer&#x2019;s heat farther south was sometimes nearly as cruel, bringing sickness and disease. But most often the days were warm and balmy. The sun shone overhead. Blankets of snow did not fall, blizzards did not paralyze whole communities. Wild cattle still roamed the center of the territory from the days of the Spaniards; they were there for the taking. The hunting was extremely rich. There were great herds of deer, a few bison still roamed the northern tracks, and there were countless rabbits and wildfowls. In the hammocks and flatlands there were areas of stunning natural beauty. There were crystal springs, incredibly deep, and still a man could see clear through the earth beneath them.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was beauty, there was danger. It was not a place for the faint of heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the Seminoles added to the savage reputation of the American territory that Andy Jackson, along with so many others, had been determined to wrest from the Spanish. There had been a time when the Spanish had ceded the territory to the British, and during and after the American Revolution, British sympathizers had flocked south. Then the Floridas&#x2014;East and West at the time&#x2014;had gone back to Spain. Americans, being Americans, had kept wandering over the borders, forever reaching for new land. Spain, they claimed, could not control the territory, could not stop the Indians from raiding American farms and plantations, and could not stop them from harboring runaway slaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> The slave issue was an explosive one. Escaped slaves readily headed south into Spanish territory that actually seemed to be ruled by the savages&#x2014;but savages with a far gentler attitude where black men were concerned. It wasn&#x2019;t that the Seminoles did not keep slaves themselves upon occasion; they did. And they could be as possessive of their property as white men when they chose. But there was a difference. Slaves might tend a Seminole master while still being free to cultivate their own plots of land. Slaves among the Seminoles were very often granted their freedom after a certain amount of service. Slaves who made it down to Florida very often found freedom, joining with free-black&#x2013;Seminole bands. Whether blacks remained free or were &#x201c;owned&#x201d; by the Indians themselves, the Seminoles did not usually return them to white masters. In the Southern states, where the economy was so solidly based on farms and plantations, slaves were very valuable personal property.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Island Of The Blue Dolphins (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. A young Indian girl learns the art of survival when she is stranded on an isolated Pacific island.</p><p>Scott O'Dell won the Newbery Medal for <i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i> in 1961, and in 1976 the Children's Literature Association named this riveting story one of the 10 best American children's books of the past 200 years. O'Dell was inspired by the real-life story of a 12-year-old American Indian girl, Karana. The author based his book on the life of this remarkable young woman who, during the evacuation of Ghalas-at (an island off the coast of California), jumped ship to stay with her young brother who had been abandoned on the island. He died shortly thereafter, and Karana fended for herself on the island for 18 years. <p> O'Dell tells the miraculous story of how Karana forages on land and in the ocean, clothes herself (in a green-cormorant skirt and an otter cape on special occasions), and secures shelter. Perhaps even more startlingly, she finds strength and serenity living alone on the island. This beautiful edition of <i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i> is enriched with 12 full-page watercolor paintings by Ted Lewin, illustrator of more than 100 children's books, including <i>Ali, Child of the Desert</i>. A gripping story of battling wild dogs and sea elephants, this simply told, suspenseful tale of survival is also an uplifting adventure of the spirit. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>978-0-547-32861-4$6.99 PA</p><h2>Shrubs of Ontario (LIFE SCIENCES MISCELLANEOUS PUBLICATION)</h2><p>The purpose of this book is to provide, in the form of a field guide or manual, a means of identifying the shrubs that can be found in Ontario growing outside cultivation. The term shrub has been variously defined. As interpreted in this book it includes perennial plants with usually more than one low-branching woody stem, also woody vines and a number of low or trailing perennials which are sometimes called subshrubs. Since certain trees occasionally develop shrubby growth with several stems from the ground, some of these have been included.</p><p></p><h2>Augustine: City of God, Volume VI, Books 18.36-20 (Loeb Classical Library No. 416)</h2><p><p>Augustinus (354&#x2013;430 CE), son of a pagan, Patricius of Tagaste in North Africa, and his Christian wife Monica, while studying in Africa to become a rhetorician, plunged into a turmoil of philosophical and psychological doubts in search of truth, joining for a time the Manichaean society. He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals.</p><p>From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the <i>Confessions</i> (in two volumes); <i>On the City of God</i> (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of <i>Letters</i> which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.</p></p><p>Augustine was born in AD 354. He lived a wild, self-destructive life as a young man in Italy and was the subject of many prayers by his worried mother, Monica. After a life-changing conversion, he lived on to become a tremendous influence on Christian thinking. He died in AD 430.</p><h2>Assassin of Gor</h2><p>Welcome to Gor, a parallel Earth, where social norms are exotic and the way of life is brutal.

Even from a distance, her papa's bellow rattled the ewer of spiced wine on the wooden table. Elspeth, her nurse, shot her a panicked look before ducking so deep into the window embrasure that her nose nearly touched the tapestry she was stitching.<br><br>Furious footsteps stampeded up the winding stairs toward the solar. Holly lifted her goblet in a half-hearted toast to the paling bard. She'd never grown immune to her father's displeasure. She'd simply learned to hide its effects. As he stormed in, she consoled herself with the knowledge that he was utterly oblivious to the presence of the man reclining on the high-backed bench opposite her.<br><br>Bernard de Chastel's ruddy complexion betrayed the Saxon heritage he would have loved to deny. Holly's trepidation grew as she recognized the seal on the wafer of wax being methodically kneaded by his beefy fist.<br><br>He waved the damning sheaf of lambskin at her. "Have you any idea what this is, girl?"<br><br>She popped a sweetmeat in her mouth and shook her head, blinking innocently. Brother Nathanael, her acerbic tutor, had taught her well. A lady should never speak with her mouth occupied by anything other than her tongue.<br><br>Flicking away the mangled seal with his thumb, her papa snapped open the letter and read, "'It is with great regret and a laden heart that I must withdraw my suit for your daughter's hand. Although I find her charms unparalleled in my experience'"&#x2013;he paused for a skeptical snort&#x2013;"'I cannot risk exposing my heir to the grave condition Lady Holly described in such vivid and disturbing detail during my last visit to Tewksbury.'" Her father glowered at her. "And just what condition might that be?"<br><br>Holly rid her mouth of the sweetmeat with an audible swallow. She briefly considered lying, but knew he'd hear of it soon enough. Brother Nathanael was also partial to lurking behind tapestries in the gleeful hope of catching her in just such a wicked fable.<br><br>"Webbed feet," she blurted out.<br><br>"Webbed feet?" he echoed, as if he couldn't possibly have heard her correctly.<br><br>She offered him a pained grin. "I told him the firstborn son of every de Chastel woman was born with webbed feet."<br><br>Elspeth gasped in horror. The minstrel frowned thoughtfully. Holly could imagine him combing his brain for words to rhyme with duck. Her father wadded up the missive, flushing scarlet to the roots of his graying hair.<br><br>"Now, Papa," she soothed. "You mustn't let yourself get so wrought up. You'll work yourself into an apoplexy."<br><br>When he had gathered enough composure to speak, his voice resonated with a false and dangerous calm. "A fortnight ago you informed Baron Kendall that the full moon provoked murderous madness in every other generation of de Chastel women, yet your own mother was meek as a lamb."<br><br>Holly nodded. She rather thought that one of her more imaginative ruses. Elspeth was signaling frantically toward the bench, but was too timid to interrupt her father.<br><br>"A sennight ago," he continued, his voice rising with each bitten off word, "you feigned crippling blindness and set fire to the plume in Lord Fairfax's favorite hat with a flaming pudding."<br><br>"How was I to know it was his favorite hat? He didn't trouble himself to&#x2013;"<br><br>"And only yesterday," her papa's voice climbed to a roar, "you painted spots on your face and intimated to Sir Henry that an unfortunate case of the pox contracted from the seat of a poorly scrubbed garderobe had endered you barren!"<br><br>The swell of masculine laughter from the bench drained the color from her father's face. His complexion went bilious as a slender man garbed in black and silver arose, chuckling and wiping his eyes. "'Tis a boon to discover my rivals for Lady Holly's affections dispatched with such celerity. The explanation is simple, my lord. Your charming daughter is saving herself for me."<br><br>"Montfort," her father whispered, realizing he'd just defamed her before her most eligible suitor. "I had no idea . . ."<br><br>"Obviously. Although I must confess webbed feet might be just the thing for paddling about the moat."<br><br>Holly found Eugene de Legget, the baron of Montfort, by far the most infuriating of her suitors. His lands bordered their own and she'd done much of her growing up beneath his piercing dark eyes. He had first petitioned her papa for her hand when she was only twelve. When the earl rejected him, pleading her youth as his excuse, Montfort had sworn to someday possess her. His impassioned vow hadn't stopped him from taking a thirteen-year-old bride to his bed while he waited for Holly to reach maturity.<br><br>Possessed of a keen intelligence and a wicked wit, he parried each of her tart rejections with renewed vigor. A master of the hunt, he seemed to savor the thrill of the chase with almost unholy pleasure. Holly shuddered. He struck her as the sort of man who would take delight in toying with his quarry once it was cornered.<br><br>"I'd ask you to join us, Papa," she said hastily, "but the baron was just making his farewells. "Wasn't he, Elspeth?"<br><br>"On the contrary." Montfort's smooth rejoinder stifled Elspeth's murmured agreement and drew a glare from Holly. His dark eyes glittered with mischief as he lounged back on the bench, hooking one lean leg over its elaborately carved arm as if he, and not her flustered father, were the host. He took a lazy sip of wine, emptying his goblet. "My minstrel was just performing a chanson I composed as a tribute to the ample charms of the future Lady Montfort." His gaze hovered at the level of her bodice, paying its own lascivious tribute to her "charms."<br><br>Holly grit her teeth behind a gracious smile. "Before your minstrel proceeds with his homage, my lord, might I entice you to partake of some more wine?"<br><br>"Why, I'd be delighted."<br><br>Before Elspeth could rise to serve him, Holly closed fingers numb with anger around the delicate handle of the silver ewer. Eugene held out his goblet with a flourish. Tipping the ewer three inches past his cup, she poured a waterfall of steaming wine into his lap.<br><br>"God's breath, woman!" He sprang to his feet, trying vainly to pull the clinging velvet of his hose away from his skin.<br><br>"How clumsy of me. 'Tis fortunate the wine had cooled somewhat." She gave his bulging codpiece a scathing look. "I doubt you'll suffer any permanent damage."<br><br>Her father's horrified scowl warned her she had gone too far this time. "You must forgive my daughter, sir. She's been troubled by a slight palsy since childhood." He hastened to add, "Nothing hereditary, of course," before flapping a fringed kerchief at the baron like a flag of truce.<br><br>Eugene shoved the offering away, his posture rigid with offended dignity. His eyes had lost their sparkle, going cold and flat like extinguished embers. For the first time, Holly paused to wonder if her rash impulse had not only discouraged an unwanted suitor but earned her a dangerous enemy.<br><br>"It appears I've overstayed my welcome. Good day, my lord," he said, drawing his cloak around his narrow shoulders. His eyes caressed Holly's face in unspoken challenge as he snapped open a silver brooch and secured his cloak with a vicious stab. "Till we meet again, my lady."<br><br>After he had departed, his minstrel dragging at his heels like a chastened pup, a shroud of appalled silence fell over the solar. Holly eased from her seat as if an economy of movement could somehow render her invisible.<br><br>"Sit!" her papa barked.<br><br>Holly sat. Elspeth edged toward the lancet window. If her father hadn't replaced the ancient wooden shutters with colored glass the previous spring. Holly was convinced her nurse would be perched on the ledge.<br><br>The earl paced to the hearth, bracing his splayed hands against its stone hood. He rocked lightly on his heels, as if even unmounted he could feel the rhythm of the countless steeds that had bandied his squat legs.<br><br>Holly considered bursting into tears, but quickly dismissed the notion. The merest hint of moisture in her limpid blue eyes had been known to drop both knaves and princes to their knees, but her father hadn't lived with her for eighteen years without learning to resist such ploys.<br><br>When she could bear his unspoken reproach no longer, she wailed, "He said I had ears like a rabbit!"<br><br>Those ears rang as her father swung around and roared, "Montfort has the king's favor. He can say you have ears like a jackass if it so pleases him!"<br><br>"And we all know how he curried His Majesty's favor, don't we? By overtaxing his poor villeins. By purchasing rotten foodstuffs for their tables and barren seed for their fields. By outlawing their precious feast days and spending the profit to buy the king's ear."<br><br>Realizing too late that her ire was a match for his own, her papa raised a placating hand. "That does not mean he would make you a poor husband."<br><br>"He made that unfortunate heiress he married a rather poor husband. Especially if you recall that the child tumbled out a tower window only hours before my eighteenth birthday. Are you that eager to see me wed?"<br><br>He rubbed the top of his head, ruffling his sparse hair. "Aye, child, I am. Most girls your age are long wedded and bedded, with two or three babes at the hearth and another on the way. What are you waiting for, Holly? I've given you over a year to choose your mate. Yet you mock my patience just as you mock the blessing of beauty our good Lord gave you."<br><br>She rose from the bench, gathering the skirts of her brocaded cotehardie to sweep across the stone floor. "Blessing! 'Tis not a blessing, but a curse!" Contempt thickened her voice. "'Holly, don't venture out in the sun. You'll taint your complexion.' 'Holly, don't forget your gloves lest you crack a fingernail.' 'Holly, don't laugh too loud. You'll strain your throat.' The men flock to Tewksbury to fawn and scrape over the musical timbre of my voice, yet no one listens to a word I'm saying. They praise the hue of my eyes, but never look into them. They see only my alabaster complexion!" She gave a strand of her hair an angry tug only to have it spring back into a flawless curl. "My raven tresses!" Framing her breasts in her hands, she hefted their generous weight. "My plump, tempting&#x2013;" Remembering too late who she was addressing, she knotted her hands over her gold-linked girdle and inclined her head, blushing furiously.<br><br>The earl might have been tempted to laugh had his daughter's tirade not underscored his terrible dilemma. Holly serene was a sight to behold, but Holly in a fit of passion could drive sane men to madness. Not even fury could mar the angelic radiance of her profile. Her black hair tumbled down her slender back like a nimbus of storm clouds. His heart was seized by the familiar twin pangs of wonder and terror. Wonder that such an exquisite creature could have sprang from the loins of a homely little troll like himself. Terror that he would prove unworthy of such a charge.<br><br>He bowed his head, battling the pained bewilderment that still blamed Felicia for dying and leaving the precocious toddler to his care. Holly had passed directly from enchanting child with dimpled knees and tumbled curls to the willowy grace of a woman grown, suffering none of the gawkiness that so frequently plagued girls in their middle years.<br><br>Now she was rumored to be the fairest lady in all of England, all of Normandy, perhaps in all the world. Strangers came from leagues away in the vain hope of catching a glimpse of her, but he allowed only the wealthiest, most reputable noblemen the boon of an audience. 'Twas not concern for her complexion that kept her locked within the castle walls, but his deep and abiding fear of abduction. His secret conviction was that some man would carry her away and defile her innocence without troubling to obtain the rightful blessing of both he and his God.<br><br>The obsession gnawed at him until he awoke in the still, dark hours between dusk and dawn, reeking of stale sweat and quaking like an old man in his bed. He <i>was</i> an old man, he reminded himself without pity. Nearly fifty. His bones creaked in complaint when he mounted his destrier. Old wounds earned battling both Scots and Welsh in the king's defense throbbed a dirge at the approach of rain. He'd done as well as he knew how by his only daughter. 'Twas past time for him to relinquish the burden to another man. Before he grew too feeble to stand between her and the avaricious world clamoring outside the castle walls.<br><br>"I've arranged for a tournament," he said without preamble.<br><br>Holly jerked her head up. Tournaments were common enough affairs, she thought. An opportunity for knights and noblemen to flex their brawny arms and secretly compare the size of their swords. So why had a gauntlet of foreboding closed steely fingers around her heart?<br><br>"A tournament?" she said lightly. "And what shall be the prize this time? A kerchief perfumed with my favorite scent? The chance to drink mulled wine from the toe of my shoe? A nightingale's song from my swanlike throat?"<br><br>"You. You're to be the prize."<br><br>Holly felt the roses in her cheeks wither and die. She gazed down into her father's careworn face, finding his gravity more distressing than his anger. She towered over him by several inches, but the mantle of majesty he had worn to shield him from life's arrows since the death of his beloved wife added more than inches to his stature.<br><br>"But, Papa, I&#x2013;"<br><br>"Silence!" He seemed to have lost all tolerance for her pleas. "I promised your mother on her deathbed that you would marry and marry you shall. Within the fortnight. If you've a quarrel with my judgment, you may retreat to a nunnery where they will teach you gratitude for the blessings God has bestowed upon you."<br><br>His bobbing gait was less sprightly than usual as he left Holly to contemplate the sentence he'd pronounced.<br><br>"A nunnery?" she echoed, drifting toward the window.<br><br>"No one would gawk at ye there, my lady." Elspeth emerged from her own self-imposed exile, her hawkish features softened by concern. "Ye could cover yer fine hair with a wimple and take a vow of silence so ye'd never have to sing at someone else's bidding."<br><br>Dire heaviness weighted Holly's heart. A nunnery. Forbidding stone walls more unscalable than those that imprisoned her now. Not a retreat, but a dungeon where all of her unspoken dreams of rolling meadows and azure skies would rot to dust.<br><br>Sinking to her knees in the stone seat, Holly unlatched the window, gazing beyond the iron grille to the outer bailey where the quadrangles of her father's lists lay like a lush green chessboard.

Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a "poetess" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America.</p><p>During her lifetime Mistral published four books: <i>Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut,</i> and <i>Winepress.</i> These are included in the "Complete" Nobel edition published in Madrid; the <i>Poem of Chile</i>, her last book, was printed years after her death. Le Guin includes poems from all five books in this volume, with particular emphasis on the later work. The intelligence and passion of Le Guin's selection and translation will finally allow people in the North to hear the originality, power, purity, and intransigence of this great American voice.</p><p>Le Guin has published five volumes of her own poetry, an English version of Lao Tzu's <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, and a volume of mutual translation with the Argentine poet Diana Bellessi, <i>The Twins, the Dream/Las Gemalas, El Sue�o.</i> Strongly drawn to Mistral's work as soon as she discovered it, Le Guin has been working on this translation for five years.</p></p><p>For the first time, the breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral&#x2019;s poetry is passionately translated to English by Le Guin in this landmark bilingual edition.The breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral&#39;s poetry is passionately translated to English by Le Guin in this landmark bilingual edition.</p><h2>Hard Labor</h2><p>Tells the stories of the twenty Africans who came to Alexandria, Virginia, in 1619 as indentured servants, hoping to serve their sentences and begin new lives in the New World.

This great new title is a celebration of Bethany&#39;s hallmark process. It contains the same easy-to-follow format and charts as her previous books, with layering and cutting of multiple pieces to produce exciting, repeated patterns.The first time I pieced a fan using wedges from a stack of identical layers left over from another project, I was hooked. This is too easy, I thought. Five straight seams and the fan unit was complete. No points to match, no centers to fuss over! Since I'm not really fond of curved piecing, I opted for a simple bias finish learned back in my dressmaking days, then straight-stitched the fan to the background square, hiding the stitching in the seamline. I knew I wasn't done, though. This was too much fun, and there were so many possibilities to explore! <p>Pointed fans are an old standard, so that was a "must-try." That led to scalloped wedges, so familiar on Dresden Plate designs. Many, many blocks later, I had worked out techniques to make a great many variations, and plenty of lovely settings for them. The techniques are interchangeable, so you can pick your favorites for your own project. </p><p>These quilts are especially enchanting with Stack-n-Whack� blocks, so of course I've included full instructions for this method.

After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio&#39;s translation of &#39;Montaigne&#39;, was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist.The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, &#39;Death at the President&#39;s Lodging&#39;. With his second, &#39;Hamlet Revenge&#39;, Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen&#39;s University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the &#39;Journeying Boy&#39;, a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973.Innes&#39;s most famous character is &#39;John Appleby&#39;, who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is &#39;Honeybath&#39;, the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in &#39;The Mysterious Commission&#39;.The last of the Innes novels, &#39;Appleby and the Ospreys&#39;, was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and &#39;Appleby&#39;s End&#39; and &#39;The New Sonia Wayward&#39; were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written.

Either an evil queen will join forces with the Inquisition and rule with a blood-spattered iron hand, threatening humans and elves alike�or a benevolent, red-haired queen named Elizabeth will rule wisely and well. But the evil Unseleighe Sidhe, who feed on human suffering and dark emotions, are determined that the little girl Elizabeth shall never grow up to take the throne. Opposing them are the good Sidhe of elfland, who have so far managed to protect the young girl. Denoriel had foiled one attempt to kidnap both Elizabeth and her half-brother and replace them with changelings, almost at the cost of his own life. But a few years have passed, and Denoriel has healed and returned to guard the young princess, now all of eight years old, secure in the knowledge that his enemy Vidal, leader of the evil Unseleighe, is dead, killed with an iron bolt fired from a primitive gun. Unfortunately, he is wrong: Vidal�s armor was far stronger than any of the good elves realized. Though the wound was deep and Vidal was forced to bide his time in his own slow healing, his recovery is complete, his determination to hurl England into a new dark age is as strong as ever, and he has set in motion a plan to achieve this end of which Denoriel and his comrades are dangerously unaware. . . .</p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b> is the author of the Bardic Voices series and the SERRAted Edge series (both Baen), the Heralds of Valdemar series (DAW), and many more.

The Bright and Dark Courts are at odds over visions of possible futures in mortal lands--futures that are to be determined by which of the king's children will rule after him. The most uncertain but most desirable outcome for the Bright Court would be the succession of Lady Elizabeth, and agents from the Dark Court are sent to watch, attack, and possibly destroy her. But Elizabeth not only has mortal and elven defenders, she has the true sight and therefore can see through a <i>sidhe</i> disguise. Lackey and Gellis continue their superior blending of English folklore and history as they briskly cover the 10 years or so between the death of Jane Seymour and that of Henry.

Reprint.</p><p>By an extraordinary quirk, the McLean family entertained Confederates at their Manassas home just before the battle of Bull Run--and also hosted the peace negotiations at Appomattox, where they had moved to escape the war. Staying close to documented facts, as detailed in an excellent note, Rinaldi uses the McLeans' lives to dramatize the war's moral dilemmas. From his marriage in 1852, Will McLean has an uneasy relationship with his feisty seven-year-old stepdaughter Osceola (``Oscie''), the narrator; though she loves and respects the northern governess Will hires, and absorbs many of her ideas, Oscie is uneasy with Will's progressive stance toward slavery and, later, with his profiteering. Some of Rinaldi's inventions are unevenly developed--Oscie's long-held suspicions of one slave (dispelled when she understands her true story); a couple of romances typical of the era--though they do fill out the story. The most compelling relationship is between Oscie and Will, strong-minded characters, often opposed, whose mutual respect turns believably into a father-daughter bond, touchingly acknowledged in the last scene. Meanwhile, the author skillfully weaves history into her story--offstage battles, resentment against profiteers, a remarkable depiction of the northern generals taking the McLeans' furniture as memorabilia of Lee's surrender. Despite some weaknesses (Oscie at seven is unbelievably mature, and there's a 20th-century feel to some of the dialogue): a sweeping, dramatic overview of the war, authentic and compelling.

He is celebrated for his apparently unpremeditated poems, autobiographical and immediate (&#39;any time, any place&#39;). This is not the whole O&#39;Hara: he may have scribbled poems on serviettes, but others he worked on with intense concentration, creating sequences that are inexhaustibly nuanced, full of surprise, heartbreak and laughter. There are analogies between his work and that of the painters he championed, Pollock, Kline and de Kooning among them. He is resolutely metropolitan, and his metropolis is New York City. He brilliantly captured the pace and rhythms, quandaries and exhilarations, of its mid-twentieth-century life.</p><p>FRANK O&#39;HARA was born in Maryland in 1926, and studied music and then English at Harvard University. His first book of poems was published in 1952. He worked at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, edited Art News and wrote extensively on painting. He died in 1966 and most of his poetry was collected by Donald Allen and appeared posthumously.<b>My Heart</b><br><br>I&#x2019;m not going to cry all the time<br>nor shall I laugh all the time,<br>I don&#x2019;t prefer one &#x201c;strain&#x201d; to another.<br>I&#x2019;d have the immediacy of a bad movie,<br>not just a sleeper, but also the big,<br>overproduced first-run kind.

Freud was twice married and the father of at least a dozen children, and his numerous relationships with women were the subject of much gossip&#x2015;but the man himself remained a mystery. An intensely private individual (during his lifetime he prevented two planned biographies from being published), Freud's life, as well as his art, invites questions that have had no answer&#x2015;until now.</p><p> In <i>Breakfast with Lucian</i>, Geordie Greig, one of a few close friends who regularly had breakfast with the painter during the last years of his life, tells an insider's account&#x2015;accessible, engaging, revealing&#x2015;of one of the twentieth century's most fascinating, enigmatic, and controversial artists. Greig, who has studied his subject's work at length, unravels the tangled thread of a life lived on Freud's own uncompromising terms. Based on private conversations in which Freud held forth on everything from first love to gambling debts to the paintings of Vel�zquez, and informed by interviews with friends, lovers, and some of the artist's children who have never before spoken publicly about their relationships with the painter, this is a deeply personal memoir that is illuminated by a keen appreciation of Freud's art. </p><p>Fresh, funny, and ultimately profound, <i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> is an essential portrait&#x2015;one worthy of one of the greatest painters of our time.</p><p>An NPR Best Book of the Year</p></p><p><b>Geordie Greig</b> is the editor of <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> and, over the last thirty years, has interviewed most major living artists. Prior to moving to Britain's largest-circulation quality Sunday newspaper, he was the editor of the <i>London Evening Standard</i>, before which he spent ten years editing <i>Tatler</i> and, previously, working as American correspondent and as literary editor for <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London). Greig lives in Notting Hill, London, with his wife, Kathryn, and their son and twin daughters.<p>&#x201c;<i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> is a superb, flawlessly crafted portrait of about as messy a life as was ever lived . . . out of which emerged the greatest British painter of the past one hundred years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tom Wolfe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Both tender biography and blunt revelation . . . It is the most important book yet written on Freud.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Brian Sewell, The Evening Standard (London)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Geordie Greig's book is an unapologetic mixture of intelligent perception and high gossip. It deepens the reader's understanding of Lucian Freud, as both man and artist . . . No person interested in Freud will ignore this book. It is, overall, more revealing than anything about him yet written.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Frances Spalding, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lucian Freud was a dedicated artist. I once heard him say, &#x2018;I will paint myself to death.' The artist was also a dedicated social butterfly. In the middle of the art and the women, titled people were never far away. Both aspects of the life would have made for a repetitive story. Geordie Greig has overcome this double hazard to write a gripping and elegant and original book, shapely and full of unexpected matter. It will surely establish him as a master biographer.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>V. S. Naipaul</i></p><p>&#x201c;Geordie Greig has written an extraordinary, candid book that is at times intensely shocking and at other times even more intensely moving.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Antonia Fraser</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Breakfast with Lucian</i>, Geordie Greig's juicy, eye-popping book about Lucian Freud . . . offers a fond but by no means whitewashed account of how Freud's spectacularly messy life relates to his extraordinary body of work . . . Along with Freud's sexual profligacy and self-destructive passion for gambling, Greig captures the intensity of the artist's ambition and drive, his exacting work ethic and his numerous &#x2018;splintered' friendships, including with fellow artist Francis Bacon. Greig's own friendship with Freud provides access to the chaos and squalor of his home and studio--littered with used brushes, flicked paint splotches and the carcasses of half-eaten dinners. His portrait comes alive with descriptions of Freud's &#x2018;ferret-thin figure,' &#x2018;shabby-chic style,' penchant for silk scarves, nougat candy, wads of cash and hair-raising drives in his brown Bentley . . . Greig's book, a rare case in which the text and illustrations are equally gripping, brings into sharp focus this bold iconoclast who &#x2018;pushed boundaries, artistic as well as sexual.' Even better, it makes us look more closely and deeply--and see more.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Heller McAlpin, The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lucian Freud was the greatest figurative painter of the 20th century, says Geordie Greig in his spirited new book, <i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> . . . [a] highly readable life of the artist . . . Mr Greig's is a compelling portrait of a complete amoralist who became a <i>monstre sacr�</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Greig tells the astonishing story behind some of Freud's most disturbing paintings and wryly observes that Freud and Sigmund, his famous grandfather, had a lot in common since it was also &#x2018;Lucian's business to get people to sit on beds or couches, and to reveal more about themselves than perhaps they wished to show.' Ironically, Lucian was a fiend for privacy, refusing interviews and derailing would-be biographers. Greig, a prominent newspaper editor, managed to get close to Freud during the painter's last decade, meeting him regularly for breakfast near his London home and studio. Freud spoke expansively about his tumultuous and maniacal life, from his Jewish German family's escape from the Nazis to his starving-artist years. Impudent, ambitious, and voracious, Freud did have a lot to hide. His prodigious sex life, a dizzying carousel of simultaneous partners, resulted in at least 14 children. Because he often paid his enormous gambling debts with paintings, a bookie owns the world's largest private Lucian Freud collection. Greig's vivid, swiftly flowing, bracingly candid, alluringly illustrated chronicle of the exploits and accomplishments of this renowned renegade artist is as arresting, discomfiting, and unforgettable as a Freud portrait.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Donna Seaman, Booklist (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[An] admiring but acerbic biography of the painter . . . The Freud who emerges in this account is a slippery figure, not only for journalists who tried to explain him but also for his intimates.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Greig interviewed Freud . . . and many of his intimates and tells an astonishing story of appetite and accomplishment. He follows the painter from childhood to the grave, fills the book with photographs of the author and his work, and expands our notion of the capabilities of the human male . . . Greig also follows the arc of Freud's career, which took years to flower but bore plenty of fruit once it did.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;A personal, anecdotal, and utterly charming book that makes you feel you've pulled up a chair and joined [Geordie Greig and Lucian Freud] for a spot of tea. If only.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lucas Wittmann, The Daily Beast</i></p><p>&#x201c;Granted access to colleagues and models and lovers and children who, confronted by an outsider, would have kept schtum, he gains a series of often surprisingly frank interviews, the contents of which he weaves into a compulsively readable life . . . Greig's considerable powers as a tour guide of character, his well-trained eye for the detail along with his insightful study of art . . . [makes for] a riveting anecdotal portrait . . . Here is Freud from many facets: compulsive gambler, the underworld figure, the high-cultural Casanova, the social climber, the devious schemer, the affectionate dad. Even oft-told stories regain a first-person freshness . . . Everywhere there are fascinating nuggets. Some illuminate his paintings . . . Most cast a strong light, and often a harsh one, on his character . . . <i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> is a fond, fair-minded, thankfully non-judgmental and pretty full portrait of a person.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rachel Campbell-Johnston, The Times (London)</i></p><p>&#x201c;In addition to having conducted some of contemporary art's biggest interviews, Greig had the rare pleasure of becoming one of Freud's few close friends towards the end of the artist's life. The two regularly shared breakfast, and it was from these early morning conversations that Greig drew much of the content in Breakfast with Lucian. Greig provides a personable inside look at an unconventional, much speculated about life. Freud speaks to Greig with varying casualness, revealing personal foibles and interests (he was an avid gambler), thoughts on, of course, his art and that of others' (amongst them Spanish Baroque painter Diego Vel�zquez) and something more universal: first love. Lending greater depth to this memoir of sorts are thoughts from friends, romantic partners and even some of Freud's children, some who've never publicly spoken about their relationships with the painter. <i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> is the book art biographers have been chasing (Freud had twice denied proposed biographies). Considering their fruitless efforts, what Greig sits on top of, on the cusp of unveiling to the world, is one of the art world's most eagerly anticipated peeks over a spiked electric fence. Art aficionados: <i>Breakfast with Lucian: The Astounding Life and Outrageous Times of Britain's Great Modern Painter</i> is not one to be missed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Leslie Ken Chu, Vancouver Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> brims with quotations from Freud's lovers, children, friends, sitters, dealers and associates, as well as from the artist himself . . . My favourite passages are those in which Greig quotes chunks of his interviews with Freud: in a flash, it feels as though we are chatting with the artist over a cup of tea, privy to his mischievous, witty and unbuttoned recollections . . . Greig also records Freud's destructive idiosyncrasies, while the final chapter, which deals with the artist's death and its aftermath, is heartfelt and upsetting.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alastair Sooke, The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;Geordie Greig, who knew him well, here reveals more about [Lucian] Freud than has ever been in print before . . . The book is excellent on Freud's extraordinary charisma, which worked its magic equally on women, men, animals and children. An especially charming passage--with accompanying photographs--describes Freud's easy playfulness with Greig's young children. The dark glamour is here, too . . . The best portraits bring their sitters vividly to life, and this book does just that. There can be no greater compliment than to say that Greig makes the reader feel exactly as if they have met Lucian Freud.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cressida Connolly, The Spectator</i></p><p>&#x201c;Geordie Greig's fascinating biography reveals a compelling but chaotic life which, until Freud's death in 2011, was largely kept veiled in secrecy by his family, friends and ex-lovers . . . The bio reveals Freud to have been a series of paradoxes . . . Greig, a former <i>Tatler </i>editor, revels in tracing the web of unlikely, unwieldy relationships that the artist liked to keep highly separate.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Lane, 3 News</i></p><p>&#x201c;We learn about the long and complicated personal life of Freud, as well as the techniques he employed as a painter, as a result of the informal meetings and breakfasts Greig had with him . . . Greig masterfully mixes hard-core biography with snippets of Q &amp; A dialogue he conducts with Freud's lovers and children and Freud himself to create a memorable portrait of a portraitist. And because Greig spent so much time in the company of Freud's paintings and studio, he has earned the right to be psychoanalytical about the grandson of the world's most famous psychoanalyst . . . the reader feels by the time the paint has dried that he has been in the company of the artist.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Masello, The Santa Fe New Mexican</i></p><p>&#x201c;Greig has done a lot of legwork--tracking down lovers and confidantes and subjects of Freud's work, including Raymond Jones, who posed for the . . . painter's first full-length nude. Jones's account of sitting is revealing of the twin obsessions of Freud's life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tim Adams, The Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Greig has drawn on interviews with those who knew Freud intimately--comprising countless girlfriends, models, dealers and bookmakers--to piece together the previously inexplicable existence of a man who compartmentalised all avenues of his life, as well as his anecdotes ranging from sleeping with horses to painting the Queen . . . Thoughtfully, he compares Freud to a cultural Forrest Gump of the 20th century, or an artistic incarnation of influential English rock band The Sex Pistols: &#x2018;Every interesting and extraordinary person of the cultural and social world seemed to pass before him, yet at the same time he was this incredibly hardworking, obsessive painter.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alex Bellotti, The Hampstead and Highgate Express</i></p><p>&#x201c;Geordie Greig, a journalist and close friend of Freud's during the latter years of his life, provides an unobstructed view into the artist's professional and private in his new memoir, <i>Breakfast with Lucian</i> . . .

They met and followed working-class ";stayers";; ambitious and college-bound ";achievers";; ";seekers,"; who head off to war to see what the world beyond offers; and ";returners,"; who eventually circle back to their hometowns. What surprised them most was that adults in the community were playing a pivotal part in the town&#x2019;s decline by pushing the best and brightest young people to leave.In a timely, new afterword, Carr and Kefalas address the question ";so what can be done to save our communities?"; They profile the efforts of dedicated community leaders actively resisting the hollowing out of Middle America.

To whet our appetites and make waiting for the book's arrival a little easier, Amazon Romance expert Alyssa Morris spoke with Day about what&#x2019;s next for Gideon and Eva, her upcoming collaboration with Harlequin and <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, her all-time favorite romance novels, and much more.</p> <p><strong>Alyssa Morris: </strong>Now that you&#x2019;ve had a bit of time to absorb the success of <i>Bared to You</i>, does it feel real? Or are you still surprised?</p> <p><strong>Sylvia Day: </strong>I'm still surprised! I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;m a veteran and that I&#x2019;ve been publishing for close to 10 years, so I had some experience under my belt as far as dealing with it. But on the other hand, there&#x2019;s no way to anticipate writing something that becomes a global phenomenon, you know. I don&#x2019;t know about other writers--I didn&#x2019;t even dream about anything like that. I always figured that it just happened to the Stephenie Meyers and J.K. Rowlings of the world. So, yeah, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll ever get over being surprised that I had a series that struck such a chord.</p> <p><strong>AM: </strong>It just hit such a moment in our culture, where all of a sudden this is what everyone wants to be reading. It&#x2019;s an interesting confluence.</p> <p><strong>SD: </strong>Right. We always talk about that, about right book, right time. Random House released <em>Fifty Shades</em> on the same day I self-published <i>Bared to You</i>, so talk about the right timing. Just... wow!</p> <p><strong>AM: </strong>Do you have a favorite moment in the Crossfire series so far?</p> <p><strong>SD: </strong>You know, I really loved the weekend that Gideon and Eva spent in the Outer Banks. These poor guys. When they&#x2019;re alone, they&#x2019;re fine. Life is perfect when they&#x2019;re alone. Unfortunately, they don&#x2019;t get a lot of time alone. [Laughs] So I just love that. I love seeing them together away from all of the distractions and intrusions and everything else that&#x2019;s going wrong in their lives.</p> <p>I can&#x2019;t talk too much about <i>Entwined with You</i> because it&#x2019;s not out yet. And that&#x2019;s so hard, because I so want to talk tabout it! But there&#x2019;s more alone time with Gideon and Eva as we move forward in the series and they grow stronger, so I&#x2019;m really enjoying that as a writer.</p> <p>Read the full interview on <strong>Omnivoracious</strong>.</p>Sylvia Day is the #1 New York Times and #1 international bestselling author of over twenty award-winning novels sold in more than forty countries.

This fine, touching and clever book is the best thing he&#39;s written since [Any Human Heart] and deserves similar adulation (Obsever); Boyd on form is the ultimate in immersive fiction, and Love is Blind is Boyd at the top of his game . magnificent (David Mills Sunday Times); Boyd&#39;s talents as a rollicking storytelling [are] full on display in this historical blockbuster (Claire Allfree Metro); A finely judged performance: a deft and resonant alchemy of fact and fiction, of literary myth and imagination (Book of the Week Guardian); The book begins and continues at a cracking pace - or perhaps a cinematic stride - with scenes, scenarios, set-pieces and minor characters aplenty, all of which and all of whom might easily detain another writer for an entire book . He makes it look easy: he&#39;s a pro (New Statesman); He has probably written more classic books than any of his contemporaries (Daily Telegraph); Boyd is a brilliant novelist (Observer); William Boyd is arguably one of Britain&#39;s finest living writers (Sunday Express). From the Inside Flap: Love is Blind is William Boyd&#39;s sweeping, heart-stopping new novel -- set at the end of the 19th century, it follows the fortunes of Brodie Moncur, a young Scottish musician, about to embark on the story of his life. When Brodie is offered a job in Paris, he seizes the chance to flee Edinburgh and his tyrannical clergyman father, and begin a wildly different new chapter in his life. In Paris, a fateful encounter with a famous pianist irrevocably changes his future - and sparks an obsessive love affair with a beautiful Russian soprano, Lika Blum. Moving from Paris to St Petersburg to Edinburgh and back again, Brodie&#39;s love for Lika and its dangerous consequences pursue him around Europe and beyond, during an era of overwhelming change as the 19th century becomes the 20th. Love is Blind is a tale of dizzying passion and brutal revenge; of artistic endeavour and the illusions it creates; of all the possibilities that life can offer, and how cruelly they can be snatched away. At once an intimate portrait of one man&#39;s life and an expansive exploration of the beginning of the twentieth century, Love is Blind is a masterly new novel from one of Britain&#39;s best loved storytellers.

His first novel, A Good Man in Africa, won the Whitbread First Novel Award and the Somerset Maugham Prize.

Records sold in their millions, a new celebrity elite emerged and Tony Blair&#39;s Labour Party found itself, at long last, returned to government.

Although Armenians and world opinion have held the Ottoman powers responsible, Turkey has consistently rejected any claim of intentional genocide.<br> Now, in a pioneering work of excavation, Turkish historian Taner Ak�am has made extensive and unprecedented use of Ottoman and other sources to produce a scrupulous charge sheet against the Turkish authorities. The first scholar of any nationality to have mined the significant evidence--in Turkish military and court records, parliamentary minutes, letters, and eyewitness accounts--Ak�am follows the chain of events leading up to the killing and then reconstructs its systematic orchestration by coordinated departments of the Ottoman state, the ruling political parties, and the military. He also probes the crucial question of how Turkey succeeded in evading responsibility, pointing to competing international interests in the region, the priorities of Turkish nationalists, and the international community's inadequate attempts to bring the perpetrators to justice.<br> As Turkey lobbies to enter the European Union, Ak�am's work becomes ever more important and relevant. Beyond its timeliness, <i>A Shameful Act</i> is sure to take its lasting place as a classic and necessary work on the subject. <br><br></p><p>Born in Ardahan Province, Turkey, in 1953, Taner Ak�am is the author of ten scholarly works of history and sociology, as well as numerous articles in Turkish, <br>German, and English.

One pictures an embattled empire, increasingly truncated by rapacious Western powers and internal nationalist movements. The other details the attempted eradication of an entire people, amid persecutions of other minorities. Part of historian Ak�am's task in this clear, well-researched work is to reconcile these mutually exclusive narratives. He roots his history in an unsparing analysis of Turkish responsibility for one of the most notorious atrocities of a singularly violent century, in internal and international rivalries, and an exclusionary system of religious (Muslim) and ethnic (Turkish) superiority. With novel use of key Ottoman, European and American sources, he reveals that the mass killing of Armenians was no byproduct of WWI, as long claimed in Turkey, but a deliberate, centralized program of state-sponsored extermination. As Turkey now petitions to join the European Union, and ethnic cleansing and collective punishment continues to threaten entire populations around the globe, this groundbreaking and lucid account by a prominent Turkish scholar speaks forcefully to all. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p><h2>The Breaking of Style: Hopkins, Heaney, Graham (The Richard Ellmann Lectures in Modern Literature)</h2><p><p>Style is the material body of lyric poetry, Helen Vendler suggests. To cast off an earlier style is to do an act of violence to the self. Why might a poet do this, adopting a sharply different form? In this exploration of three kinds of break in poetic style, Vendler clarifies the essential connection between style and substance in poetry. Opening fresh perspectives on the work of three very different poets, her masterful study of changes in style yields a new view of the interplay of moral, emotional, and intellectual forces in a poet&#x2019;s work.</p><p>Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x2019; invention of sprung rhythm marks a dramatic break with his early style. Rhythm, Vendler shows us, is at the heart of Hopkins&#x2019; aesthetic, and sprung rhythm is his symbol for danger, difference, and the shock of the beautiful. In Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s work, she identifies clear shifts in grammatical &#x201c;atmosphere&#x201d; from one poem to the next&#x2015;from &#x201c;nounness&#x201d; to the &#x201c;betweenness&#x201d; of an adverbial style&#x2015;shifts whose moral and political implications come under scrutiny here. And finally Vendler looks at Jorie Graham&#x2019;s departure from short lines to numbered lines to squared long lines of sentences, marking a move from deliberation to cinematic &#x201c;freeze-framing to coverage, each with its own meaning in this poet&#x2019;s career.</p><p>Throughout, Vendler reminds us that what distinguishes successful poetry is a mastery of language at all levels&#x2015;including the rhythmic, the grammatical, and the graphic. A fine study of three poets and a superb exposition of the craft of poetry, <i>The Breaking of Style</i> revives our lapsed sense of what style means.</p></p><p>Helen Vendler is A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University.&#x201c;Vendler is a critic readers of poetry, inside the academy and out, should take seriously... She writes less as a scholar (though her learning is prodigious) than as one impelled by the special pleasure she finds in poems to trace each instance of that pleasure to its source... While [<i>The Given and the Made</i> and <i>The Breaking of Style</i>] offer complex, sometimes difficult interpretations of work that is itself often difficult, they hew close to the primary experiences of wonder and conviction that is poetry&#x2019;s special power to evoke. Her prose is...lucid and elegant... [In <i>The Breaking of Style</i>] the chapter on Hopkins is a <i>tour de force</i>, the most concise and helpful account I have seen of the dense, jarring, strangely musical meter the Victorian Jesuit called &#x2018;sprung rhythm&#x2019; ...Vendler&#x2019;s argument, in <i>The Given and the Made</i>, is that poetry is a special way of confronting, and symbolically resolving, the hard facts of life. And poetry, which has for so long seemed to be approaching an ultimate marginality, surely needs defenders like Vendler, so committed to protecting its singularity as an art form... These [are] illuminating books.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. O. Scott</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Helen Vendler is justly admired as the author of critical studies of George Herbert, Keats, W. B. Yeats, and Wallace Stevens. Her current project is a study of Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets. She is also the most influential reviewer of contemporary poetry in English: her reviews of new books of poetry appear frequently and forcefully in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, <i>Parnassus</i>, and other journals... [H]er gifts are so immense... The new books [<i>Soul Says</i>, <i>The Given and the Made</i>, and <i>The Breaking of Style</i>] have a number of such [acute] analyses, continuously alert to the detail of the poems... One of the pleasures of reading Vendler&#x2019;s criticism is that of seeing a poet&#x2019;s achievement lavishly appreciated... The most valuable chapters in the three new books are those in which Vendler leads us through difficult poems... After [she does so], the poem is still to be read, and read again, word by word, line, sequence, image cut into image. We have to get back from the discursive model, which Vendler so clearly describes, to the local movement and texture of the poem. But after Vendler&#x2019;s commentary we are in a much better position to do so. I cannot think of a better justification for a critic&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Denis Donoghue</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It is the mark of [Vendler&#x2019;s] greatness as a critic that, when there is a conflict between the schematism and the poem, it is the schematism which must give way. The critic must be faithful to the poem, not to her preconceptions... Her readings of individual poems are rarely less than exemplary... The kind of thing [Vendler] is after is clear enough&#x2015;the sort of poetry after which &#x2018;the world never seems the same again.&#x2019; Of all critics, she seems one of those best qualified to find it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Roger Caldwell</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There is perhaps no better critic than Vendler who can tell us so well how poems are made.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Clyde de Loache Ryals</b><b>, </b><b><i>Studies in English Literature, 1500&#x2013;1900</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In the collections of essays <i>The Breaking of Style</i> and <i>The Given and the Made</i> Helen Vendler...firmly positions herself as one of our most authoritative voices on modern and contemporary poetry. Already an authority on Keats and Stevens among others, Vendler moved several years ago into the realm of contemporary poetry, where she has quickly established herself as a major critic. Vendler has always been a skilled practitioner of close reading, but in the essays of these two volumes she becomes an articulate apologist for the intensive attention to details of style and form that has come to be identified with New Criticism. Eschewing the current hegemony of theory in literary scholarship, Vendler makes the case in these essays that not only is there still a place for an exclusive engagement with the details of textual analysis, but to fail to address the details of a poem&#x2019;s making is to ignore its physical presence.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Kaiser</b><b>, </b><b><i>World Literature Today</i></b></p><h2>Tempt the Stars (Cassie Palmer)</h2><p>Being a goddess is a lot less fun than you might think. Especially when you&#x2019;re only a half goddess, and you only found out about it recently, and you still don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re doing half the time. And when you&#x2019;ve just used your not-so-reliable powers to burglarize the booby-trapped office of a vampire mob boss.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yeah, that part sucks.<br>&nbsp;<br>But that&#x2019;s just the tip of the iceberg for Cassandra Palmer, aka the Pythia, the freshly minted chief seer of the supernatural world. After all, Cassie still has to save a friend from a fate worse than death, deal with an increasingly possessive master vampire, and prevent a party of her own acolytes from unleashing a storm of fury upon the world. Totally just your average day at the office, right?</p><p><b>Karen Chance </b>has lived in France, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, but always comes back to America. She currently lives in central Florida, the home of make-believe, which may explain a lot.&nbsp;&#x201c;You gots big.&#x201d;<p>The small voice came from the even smaller girl in the doorway. She was hard to see, shimmering in the night like the moonbeams falling through her, and overwritten by the hazy, graffiti snarl of ghost trails weaving through the air. I felt some of the muscles in my neck unclench.</p><p>And then tense back up when a too-loud voice called from a nearby room, &#x201c;Cassie?&#x201d;</p><p>I refrained from jumping&#x2014;just. Abrupt movements might scare her, and I couldn&#x2019;t afford that now. &#x201c;Be right there,&#x201d; I said softly, smiling reassuringly at the ghost girl.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; the voice asked, louder this time.</p><p>I looked behind me to see the wild white head of my partner in crime, Jonas Marsden, poking out of an office door. With the crazy hair and the pink cheeks and the Coke bottle glasses, he looked like Einstein on acid. But, despite appearances, he deserved his position as the de facto leader of the magical world. Jonas headed up the powerful Silver Circle, the largest organization of magic workers on earth.</p><p>But great mages are still human, and Jonas&#x2019; ego wasn&#x2019;t taking the aging thing well. Like when he refused to put a hearing spell on himself because the rest of us just talked too lowly. Unfortunately, the same couldn&#x2019;t be said for him.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to whisper,&#x201d; he bellowed. &#x201c;I assure you, the shield will hold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you keep telling me.&#x201d; He was talking about the sound-deadening spell he&#x2019;d cast to keep any noise we made from filtering out into the rest of the house. That was kind of important, since we were hovering on train-wreck territory here. Of course, that pretty much described my life lately.</p><p>My name is Cassie Palmer, and I&#x2019;m the newly crowned Pythia, aka the world&#x2019;s chief seer. That sounds a lot more impressive than it is, since so far it&#x2019;s mostly involved giving taxi rides through time to strange people, in between almost getting killed. As I was currently a couple of decades back, trying to rob my old vampire master along with a guy who made eccentric look boring, today was pretty average.</p><p>But my nerves didn&#x2019;t think so.</p><p>Maybe that&#x2019;s why the spotted mirror over the fireplace showed me short blond curls that looked like I&#x2019;d been running nervous fingers through them, a face pale enough to make my freckles stand out starkly, and wide, startled blue eyes. And a T-shirt that proclaimed Good girls just never get caught.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s hope so, I thought fervently.</p><p>Fortunately, as vampire courts went, this one was pretty lax, being run by a guy who had been the Renaissance equivalent of white trash. But Tony had one hard-and-fast rule: nobody missed dinner. I wasn&#x2019;t sure why, because vampires don&#x2019;t need to eat&#x2014;food, anyway. And most don&#x2019;t, since any below master level, the gold standard for vamps, have nonworking taste buds.</p><p>Maybe it was tradition, something he&#x2019;d done in life and still clung to in death. Or maybe he was being his usual asinine self and just wanted to enjoy his dinner in front of a bunch of people who mostly couldn&#x2019;t. Either way, it meant that Jonas and I should have an hour before anybody interrupted us.</p><p>Assuming the spell held, anyway.</p><p>Jonas didn&#x2019;t look too worried. &#x201c;You could dance an Irish jig in here,&#x201d; he boasted, &#x201c;in clogs, and no one would hear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but they might feel the reverberations&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In this?&#x201d; He gestured around at the creaks of Revolution-era floorboards, the lash of rain against centuries-old windows, and the intermittent lightning that cracked the sky outside, sending shadows leaping across original plaster walls. Tony lived in a historic farmhouse in the Pennsylvania countryside, which was usually picture-postcard pretty.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t one of those times.</p><p>&#x201c;Or scent us,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>&#x201c;From across the house?&#x201d; Jonas scoffed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not superhuman.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. &#x201c;Well, actually&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You give your vampires too much credit, Cassie,&#x201d; he told me severely. &#x201c;In a contest between them and a good mage, always bet on the mage!&#x201d;</p><p>Well, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing, I was going to point out. But I didn&#x2019;t because I wanted him to shut up already. I&#x2019;m not usually twitchy, but then, I don&#x2019;t usually try to burglarize the booby-trapped office of a vampire mob boss, either. Not that I was doing that now. That was Jonas&#x2019; thing. I was here for something else.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, glancing nervously back at the girl.</p><p>Mercifully, she was still there, even a bit more substantial now. The old doll she dragged around by the hair had taken on a pinkish hue, and her dress, part of which disappeared through the floor, was now a pale shade of blue. I let out a breath I hadn&#x2019;t known I&#x2019;d been holding.</p><p>The ghost&#x2019;s name was Laura and we&#x2019;d played together as kids, back when I called this place home. Only I&#x2019;d grown up and she . . . well, she never would.</p><p>It&#x2019;s one of the hard facts about ghosts: when you die, you pretty much stay the same way you were in life. Meaning if you&#x2019;re a one-armed man, you&#x2019;re going to be a one-armed ghost; it&#x2019;s just the way the energy manifests. Mostly, they learn to roll with it Beetlejuice style, throwing severed heads at unsuspecting tourists&#x2014;the ghostly term for cemetery visitors&#x2014;or trailing disemboweled intestines after them like a gory train.</p><p>Humor tends to take on a macabre bent after death.</p><p>But the downside is that, if you die at five years old, you stay five. You might learn new things, acquire new skills, even gain wisdom of a sort. But it&#x2019;s a kid&#x2019;s wisdom. You don&#x2019;t suddenly start thinking like an adult.</p><p>Even after more than a hundred years you don&#x2019;t.</p><p>That was a problem, since I needed information, and I needed it badly. Specifically, I needed to talk to my mother, who had once been Tony&#x2019;s guest, too. But who had died when I was younger than Laura appeared now.</p><p>Of course, visiting a dead woman should be easy enough for a time traveler, right? Only I never get easy. I&#x2019;d spent the better part of a week looking for her, and come up with zilch. But I had to find her; a friend was in trouble and Mom was the only one who might know how to help him. And there was a damned good chance that Laura knew where she was.</p><p>But if I remembered right, getting her cooperation was likely to be tricky.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Laura&#x2014;&#x201d; I began casually.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201d; she asked, dragging her dolly over into the wedge of light coming out of the office.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I whispered, trying to keep her out here, where we could talk in private.</p><p>So, of course, she went right on in.</p><p>I closed my eyes.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been able to talk to ghosts for as long as I can remember, far longer than I&#x2019;ve been doing my current crazy job. But it&#x2019;s like with people&#x2014;they talk to you only when they want to. Of course, they usually want to, since most ghosts are confined to a single place and don&#x2019;t get many visitors. Well, many who notice them, anyway. So if Jonas hadn&#x2019;t been here, I&#x2019;d probably have been getting my ear chewed off.</p><p>But he was, and of the two of us, he was clearly the more interesting.</p><p>I accepted the inevitable and followed her inside.</p><p>Jonas must have done some dismantling, because nothing shot, stabbed, or grabbed me as I passed through the door. He looked pretty okay, too, if you ignored his habit of picking up random things and sticking them in the billowing mass he called hair. Or, in this case, on.</p><p>&#x201c;He looks like Honeybun.&#x201d; Laura giggled. She was talking about my childhood pet rabbit, the one we&#x2019;d basically shared since animals can sense ghosts a lot better than people can.</p><p>And she wasn&#x2019;t wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you find something?&#x201d; Jonas asked, looking up from sorting through the mess on the desk. And sporting two outrageous tufts of white hair escaping from either side of an old fedora. It didn&#x2019;t match his outfit, and he hadn&#x2019;t had it on when we arrived. But I&#x2019;d already discovered that trying to figure out Jonas only made my head hurt, so I mostly didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just fluffy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, no. Not yet,&#x201d; I told him, trying to surreptitiously shoo Laura back out the door.</p><p>She crawled under the desk instead.</p><p>&#x201c;Done already?&#x201d; Jonas asked, looking at me over the tops of his glasses as I crawled after her.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you certain you didn&#x2019;t overlook anything? It&#x2019;s quite small, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty sure.&#x201d;</p><p>What he wanted wasn&#x2019;t in the outer office. I knew that because I knew where it was, but I needed him to take a few minutes to find it. Minutes that I could use to pry some secrets out of Laura. But Jonas wasn&#x2019;t looking like he felt like giving them to me. For once, Jonas was looking focused.</p><p>&#x201c;This is no time for games, Cassie,&#x201d; he said sternly, as Laura crawled through his legs.</p><p>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t agree more,&#x201d; I muttered, grabbing for her.</p><p>Only to have her go abruptly less substantial, and my hands to pass right on through. And grab Jonas&#x2019; calf instead. &#x201c;Is there a problem?&#x201d; he asked dryly.</p><p>Yes, although the fading wasn&#x2019;t it. Laura&#x2019;s senses didn&#x2019;t work as well when she wasn&#x2019;t all there, so to speak, and she was curious enough to be back any second. The problem was worse than that.</p><p>The problem was that she thought I wanted to play.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, wait&#x2014;oh, shit,&#x201d; I hissed as she blinked completely out of sight.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Jonas tensed, staring around. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Laura giggled and reappeared over by the threadbare plaid sofa, where Tony parked his guests so he could watch them squirm on the tough old springs. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t catch me!&#x201d; she said, throwing out the usual challenge.</p><p>It had been fun when I was a child and didn&#x2019;t have anything better to do. It was less so now. &#x201c;No, listen&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am listening,&#x201d; Jonas said impatiently, as she disappeared again.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>I crawled out from under the desk. &#x201c;Cassie, what&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a second,&#x201d; I told him, through gritted teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;Even for a Pythia, you&#x2019;re acting a bit crazed,&#x201d; he said mildly as I stomped out.</p><p>Not half as crazed as I was going to be if I didn&#x2019;t find a certain playful ghost, I thought grimly, staring around the outer room.</p><p>Nothing stared back, except for an old portrait on the wall, some glowering relative of the family that used to own this place before Tony decided he wanted it. It was limned with moonlight, like everything else in here, which was a problem. When faded, ghosts were little more than silver smudges, and damned hard to spot in a chiaroscuro of old furniture, stuffy portraits, and leaping shadows. Lightning flashed outside, making the whites of the painted eyes stand out creepily.</p><p>&#x201c;No fair hiding,&#x201d; I called tensely.</p><p>But it looked like I was the only one who thought so.</p><p>This really wasn&#x2019;t going to be easy. And what else was new? I thought savagely. If there was one thing I&#x2019;d learned in the last three months, it was that nothing ever was. It was like living in Murphy&#x2019;s Law.</p><p>Only no.</p><p>That would be a step up.</p><p>According to Murphy, if something can go wrong, it will. But that wouldn&#x2019;t work for my life. I needed a new rule. Cassie&#x2019;s rule. Something along the lines of &#x201c;if something can&#x2019;t go wrong, because it is completely impossible for it to happen in the first place, it will somehow manage to go wrong anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>Case in point: most people would agree that having one&#x2019;s father killed by a vampire mob boss was kind of unlikely. And that having the soul of said father end up trapped in an enchanted paperweight, because the vampire was an asshole who wanted to gloat over his former servant for as long as possible, was just plain silly. Add in the fact that the fate of the world might now hinge on that paperweight and the spirit it held and the whole thing edged into the ludicrous. And if the magical community managed to lose said all-important paperweight, because said bastard of a vampire ran off to Faerie with it . . . well. I don&#x2019;t even know if they have a word for that.</p><p>But they need one. Because it happened anyway. Just like that, to me.</p><p>See the kind of thing I&#x2019;m dealing with here?</p><p>But right now retrieving the paperweight of doom was Jonas&#x2019; problem. He was the one trying to save a world. I wasn&#x2019;t that ambitious. I was just trying to save a friend.</p><p>And it wasn&#x2019;t going so great.</p><p>I gave up on subtlety and pulled the world&#x2019;s ugliest necklace out of my T-shirt.</p><p>A second later, a ghost appeared, like a genie from a bottle. Only this genie was wearing cowboy chic and looking pretty spooked. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he told me flatly. &#x201c;No way, no how. Don&#x2019;t even think about&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a lot of time here,&#x201d; I whispered harshly. &#x201c;And she can do this for hours. We had a game that lasted a whole week once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s my problem how?&#x201d; he asked, glancing around nervously. &#x201c;Damn, it&#x2019;s worse than I remembered. This whole place is dripping with ectoplasm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know there&#x2019;s no such thing,&#x201d; I said impatiently. The ghost&#x2019;s name was Billy Joe, and despite being among the life-challenged himself, he didn&#x2019;t know crap about death. Maybe because he spent eternity watching cheesy old movies and driving me crazy.</p><p>We&#x2019;d met when I was seventeen, and accidentally bought the necklace he haunted as a birthday gift for my governess. She&#x2019;d ended up with some unhaunted hankies instead, and I got a nineteenth-century Irish gambler with a big mouth and a yellow streak. Some days, I still think she came out ahead.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; Billy asked, his usual sarcasm overwritten by a tinge of panic. &#x201c;Stop looking around like a human and check out Ghost Vision for a change!&#x201d;</p><p>His tone gave it capitals when it was really just the way seers look at the world. Some people are double-jointed; we&#x2019;re double-sighted, with that second set of eyes, the kind that focuses on the spirit world. I usually tried to tamp it down, since watching others tends to make it more likely that they&#x2019;re going to watch you back, and there&#x2019;s some scary stuff out there. But it didn&#x2019;t look like I was going to be finding Laura any other way.</p><p>&#x201c;See what I mean?&#x201d; Billy demanded, when I switched over. Only now, instead of a semitransparent cowboy in a ruffled shirt and a Stetson, he was a shining green column of vaguely cowboy-shaped smoke. And less distinct, instead of more as should have been the case, because he&#x2019;d been right&#x2014;the whole room glowed with the same eerie color.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just that the farmhouse&#x2019;s previous owners had met a messy end. This place had started out as an Indian burial mound long before anybody ever built on it, and after that had been a battlefield in the Revolutionary War. And then there were the various rivals Tony had dragged back through the years, most of whom had ended up never leaving. And the vengeful spirits that had followed a few of the vamps home, wanting a little post-carnage payback. The final result was basically ghost central, with the glowing trails they left so thick on the floor and walls and ceiling that the whole room pulsed neon.</p><p>&#x201c;You know the guys around here hate other ghosts,&#x201d; Billy said, whipping his head around at some sound I couldn&#x2019;t hear. &#x201c;Like, really, really hate them!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is supposed to be sacred ground,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;The original owners didn&#x2019;t like the newbies, and they&#x2019;ve been battling it out ever since.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, they can battle it out without me,&#x201d; Billy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d; And he started to disappear back int...</p></p><h2>Eagle in Exile: The Clash of Eagles Trilogy Book II</h2><p><b>Perfect for fans of Bernard Cornwell, Steve Berry, Naomi Novik, and Harry Turtledove, Alan Smale&#x2019;s gripping alternate history series imagines a world in which the Roman Empire has survived long enough to invade North America in 1218.

The Iroqua captives sweated in their corral in the East Plaza, with the Great Mound and the Mound of the Smoke looming over them on either side. They had been imprisoned there for many weeks in all kinds of weather, with no shelter and minimal food. Water was provided twice daily from a single well-guarded jar. They could drink only as much as their cupped hands would hold.<br><br>Marcellinus had seen his fair share of suffering but rarely such extended neglect. Even the slave pens in the ports of Europa and Aethiopia had roofs and reasonably plentiful fodder, but slaves had resale value, and these braves had none.<br><br>Cahokian Wolf Warriors ringed the corral. There would be no breakouts or rescue attempts, and even if the gates were opened, the captives would be too weak to run.<br><br>These were Cahokia&#x2019;s sworn enemies, brought as low as men could get. This was the fate the rest of the Iroqua nation would face if Great Sun Man could bring it about.<br><br>Marcellinus had little sympathy for the prisoners. Any of these men would have delighted in butchering him and the people he cared about, hacking off their scalps to wear on their belts. On the basis of the atrocities committed by Iroqua war parties in the upland villages, he had no doubt that Cahokians in an Iroqua corral would fare even worse. But he did think it was a waste.<br><br>Absently, he fingered the golden amulet that Enopay had found for him. He had turned it over and over in his hands so often over the last several weeks that the image of the Hawk warrior incised on its flat surface was beginning to wear down.<br><br>If Cahokia had gold and the Iroqua wanted it, the Mourning War would be comprehensible. But it did not. And if the Iroqua had wanted Cahokian women, they would have taken them after the battle. They had taken a few, but it was obviously not the prime reason for their attack.<br><br>Revenge was the only motivation left. But really, revenge for what? Where could such unreasoning hatred have come from?<br><br>Marcellinus had been standing for some time before he noticed that he was not alone. Just a hundred feet away stood Pezi, who was also staring at the prisoners.<br><br>Deep in his own reverie, Pezi jumped when Marcellinus arrived at his side. Marcellinus had not seen the word slave from Etowah since the previous winter.<br><br>Embarrassingly, Pezi fell to his knees. &#x201c;Wanageeska!&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus had forgotten how abject a creature the boy was. &#x201c;Gods&#x2019; sakes, Pezi, stand up and pretend to be a man.&#x201d;<br><br>Pezi stood, eyes still downcast. He had grown an inch or two, and wisps of new hair adorned his chin and cheeks.<br><br>&#x201c;Where were you during the battle, Pezi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I fight for Cahokia,&#x201d; Pezi said.<br><br>Marcellinus regarded him calmly. &#x201c;Who saw you fight?&#x201d;<br><br>Pezi hesitated. &#x201c;No. I hide down in a grain pit, under a house. I am not good to fight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Again?&#x201d; Such a pit was where they originally had found Pezi, in the mound-builder town of Woshakee up the Oyo River.<br><br>Pezi was taller and probably stronger than Tahtay, who had valiantly tried to fight and had suffered a terrible injury to his leg in the attempt. Marcellinus swallowed. &#x201c;What do they want, Pezi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus waved at the prisoners.<br><br>Pezi shook his head. &#x201c;To die quickly, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All the Iroqua. They want Cahokia destroyed, the Mizipian people scattered, scalped, or buried in the earth? Or do they want something else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s ask them.&#x201d;<br><br>Grabbing the boy&#x2019;s arm, he began to walk forward. Pezi resisted, standing his ground. &#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You still speak Iroqua?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. But you will learn nothing from those men. Even if they have anything to tell, they will not tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know the Iroqua,&#x201d; Marcellinus said bluntly. &#x201c;You speak their language. And here they are, attacking Cahokia. But really, Pezi, why? For Cahokian land? Cahokian corn and women? Access to the Mizipi? Roman weapons? I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s all of it. I really don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know.&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus loomed over the boy and held his gaze. &#x201c;You understand your life belongs to me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you know I can have you put in there&#x2014;&#x201d; He indicated the corral. &#x201c;&#x2014;with just a single word?&#x201d;<br><br>Pezi gave a little whimper.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost my legion and most of the friends I once had here. I have very little left to lose, Pezi. And you would not be the first translator I&#x2019;ve killed for talking out of both sides of his mouth. So tell me the truth before I lose patience. What do you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Iroqua fear Cahokia,&#x201d; said the boy. &#x201c;There was war in the past. Many Iroqua raids and Cahokian raids. Now, with you here, the Iroqua fear that the People of the Mounds will come and kill them all. So they must strike first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonsense.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Haudenosaunee lands and lakes are small, and the Cahokian and mound-builder rivers are long. And now Cahokia rules the air. What else can the Iroqua do?&#x201d;<br><br>Just what Marcellinus had thought when he saw Sintikala&#x2019;s great map of Nova Hesperia. But hearing the words from Pezi&#x2019;s mouth made him resist the idea. &#x201c;Cahokians do not want Iroqua lands. What threat is there to the Iroqua from mound builders? Will Cahokians force Iroqua to build mounds? No. What reason is that to attack mound-builder villages and towns and wage war on Cahokia itself?&#x201d;<br><br>Pezi looked away. &#x201c;As you say.&#x201d;<br><br>If Cahokia were Roma, the threat to neighboring lands would be obvious. But Great Sun Man was not an Imperator, and surely the Iroqua lands had nothing that Cahokia could possibly want.<br><br>&#x201c;Pezi, how did the Mourning War start between Iroqua and Cahokia?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of you, making Cahokia stronger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Long before me. Generations ago. Was it because the Iroqua wanted Cahokian women?&#x201d;<br><br>Pezi paused. &#x201c;Long past, many lives ago, this city was not here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And before? Did the Iroqua live here?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy laughed scornfully. &#x201c;By this big greasy river that bursts its banks every spring? The Iroqua would not live here. But on the Oyo, the Iroqua were strong. Then came Cahokia, and then the Oyo belonged to the mound builders, too, and the Iroqua had only the lakes.&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus thought about it. &#x201c;Pezi, the time may come when I will ask something of you. It will be just one thing, but you must do it. Afterward you will owe me nothing. Your life will be your own. But if you do not do what I ask, the whole of this land will not be big enough for you to hide from me. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br><br>Pezi was already pale and shaking. &#x201c;What must I do?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus released the boy. &#x201c;When I am ready, I will tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am looking for Wachiwi,&#x201d; Marcellinus said.<br><br>The warrior Takoda sat cross-legged on the ground. His left arm cradled Ciqala, his son of two winters; his right arm was splinted and heavily bandaged from the wounds he had received protecting Marcellinus in battle. From the other side of the fire his wife, Kangee, made a wordless grunt of disgust. Their newborn, whose name Marcellinus did not know, lay sleeping in a cradleboard on Kangee&#x2019;s back as she built the fire.<br><br>If it had been only Takoda, Marcellinus might have explained. But he did not really care what they thought, and especially he did not need to explain himself to Kangee, who had always loathed him.<br><br>&#x201c;Is Wachiwi alive? Just tell me where she is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ask Hanska,&#x201d; said Takoda.<br><br>Marcellinus was taken aback. He would not have thought that the fierce warrior woman Hanska and the gentle Wachiwi would know each other. &#x201c;And where is Hanska?&#x201d;<br><br>Takoda nodded to the southeast, then sighed. &#x201c;The way is hard to describe. I will fetch Hanska here to you if you will bring us firewood and water.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would bring you firewood and water anyway if you asked,&#x201d; Marcellinus said.<br><br>Kangee spit into the fire. It fizzled. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need his help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With two babies, and Ina like that?&#x201d; said Takoda wearily, nodding toward the hut where his mother, Nahimana, lay. &#x201c;And me with a smashed-up arm? If we don&#x2019;t need help, who does?&#x201d;<br><br>Kangee stalked off without another word, squatting in front of a neighbor&#x2019;s fire and casting foul looks over her shoulder. Once she was safely out of earshot, Takoda said after her, &#x201c;Hey, by the way, Marcellinus saved my life at Woshakee.&#x201d;<br><br>Takoda was referring back to a conversation many moons ago, a lie that Hanska had suggested he tell Kangee to make her warm to the Roman. Marcellinus smiled, grateful at even the pretense of humor on such a dour day. Shrugging sadly, Takoda put his son on his hip and walked away across the Great Plaza.<br><br>Marcellinus fetched a wheelbarrow and packed as much wood into it as he could. On his second trip he brought back four large jars of water. He also brought one of the new metal fire stands and a cooking pot that was the right size to fit it. By the time Takoda returned with Hanska by his side, bouncing Ciqala in her arms, Marcellinus had restarted the fire, heated water, and stepped down into their hut to bathe the still-comatose Nahimana.<br><br>Nahimana had survived the sack of Cahokia by the Iroqua with flying colors. She had worked without cease or sleep for the next two days looking after the wounded and then, quietly and with little fuss, had suffered a stroke. Now, two moons later, she still lay unconscious most hours of the day. The left side of her face hung piteously slack. Yet another casualty of war on Marcellinus&#x2019;s conscience.<br><br>Takoda looked sad. &#x201c;Wanageeska, you don&#x2019;t have to do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanska cleared her throat and handed Ciqala back to his father. &#x201c;Need help, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>It was the first time Hanska had ever called him &#x201c;sir&#x201d; as if she meant it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Help me turn her over. Wait outside, Takoda. No son should see his mother like this.&#x201d;<br><br>Gently and almost effortlessly, Hanska hefted the frail form of the elderly woman and rolled her onto her front. As for Hanska, long smears of the white salve on her legs and right shoulder were the only remaining signs of the wounds she had sustained fighting the Iroqua, though she seemed to favor her right side. &#x201c;So you want Wachiwi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just to talk with her.&#x201d; Marcellinus rinsed his cloth in the pot of warm water.<br><br>&#x201c;Talk only?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Believe it or not.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanska plucked the cloth from his hand. &#x201c;This is woman&#x2019;s work. I am still a woman,&#x201d; she said, and took over the task of cleaning Nahimana, doing it more thoroughly than Marcellinus would have dared. Grateful, he looked away.<br><br>When they left the house, Kangee was back.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, little Kangee,&#x201d; Hanska said. &#x201c;If the Wanageeska wants Wachiwi, he wants Wachiwi. Is it for you to sneer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did not speak of this to you, warrior,&#x201d; Kangee said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I speak of it now. Answer me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Hanska,&#x201d; said Marcellinus.<br><br>Hanska loomed over Kangee, and the shells braided into her hair rattled. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s saved Cahokian lives. Made us strong. The Wanageeska has done more for Cahokia than you ever will. All you do is breed and spit.&#x201d;<br><br>Takoda stood. &#x201c;Hanska. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; she said to Marcellinus.<br><br>They walked a little west of south, past a flooded borrow pit toward an area of Cahokia where Marcellinus rarely went, the neighborhood of the cloth workers, leather tanners, and makers of moccasins. Despite lying on a line directly between the two main battles with the Iroqua, it appeared relatively unscathed.<br><br>Hanska strode beside him. Marcellinus had never been alone with her before. He wanted to thank her for keeping him alive, for standing over him and defending him as he lay stunned from the Huron&#x2019;s club, but he knew she would say something offhand and contemptuous if he dared mention it. After all, he would have done the same for her. They were warriors. &#x201c;So you know Wachiwi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus eyed her, uncertain. She looked irritated. &#x201c;What? No. What you are thinking now? All men think that, because they are men. But Wachiwi and I have not been lovers. We were friends long ago, as children.&#x201d;<br><br>This was a surprise. &#x201c;I would not have thought it. You are very different.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You say so? Because I am not pretty like Wachiwi?&#x201d;<br><br>Once again the ground was shifting under his feet. Marcellinus really was &#x201c;no good chieftain of women,&#x201d; as Sintikala once had told him. &#x201c;I did not mean&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were different from other girls. She was Onida, taken from the Iroqua. And I was not girl-like.&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus remembered Tahtay&#x2019;s young friend Hurit, bloodied by bullies the previous year for being too interested in making bricks in Marcellinus&#x2019;s brickworks. &#x201c;Yes, I see.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanska threw him another sharp look. I see? Yes, he had said the wrong thing again, implying an insult.<br><br>In fact, Marcellinus found Hanska spectacular. Well muscled, statuesque, but still strikingly female, she could have been cast in marble in the Roman Pantheon. But she was one of his warriors. It would not be proper to tell her that.<br><br>Futete. He would never lead the First Cahokian in battle again. But still she daunted him. He resorted to hand-talk. You strong. Beautiful. I sorry.<br><br>Hanska faltered and dropped her gaze. Perhaps she was regretting saving his life. But when he looked back, he found she was making hand-talk, too. We know what it is to be different. That why you-I friends, too.<br><br>Wachiwi, Hanska, Marcellinus. All outsiders. All very different. Marcellinus was embarrassed that he had never before thought of Hanska as a friend.<br><br>&#x201c;I have bearberry tea,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let us drink some.&#x201d;<br><br>Finally he earned a grin. &#x201c;You want to see Wachiwi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At another time, then. As friends.&#x201d; Her husband, Mikasi, he now remembered, was also an outsider, born far away in the grassy prairies across the Mizipi to the west of Cahokia. How ignorant he was about people that it took him so long to decode such obvious connections.<br><br>Hanska leaned in to him. &#x201c;Maybe. But sir? This time, be more nice to Wachiwi. Or you and I will never drink tea.&#x201d;<br><br>A hot flush filled Marcellinus&#x2019;s cheeks. Naturally, Wachiwi would have spoken to Hanska of her brief physical relationship with him. All at once the warrior woman&#x2019;s habitual rudeness and overfamiliarity made sense.<br><br>&#x201c;I mean Wachiwi no harm,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If I hurt her, I did not mean to.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanska laughed. &#x201c;Do not worry. Wachiwi is tougher than either of us.&#x201d;<br><br>They had walked past the last of the leatherworkers and were approaching a single house standing apart from the others, close to a low ridge mound. A small figure had seen them coming and was waiting outside.<br><br>Wachiwi and Hanska hugged. It was odd to see, the tall and muscular clasping the petite and shapely.<br><br>Wachiwi made no move to greet Marcellinus but regarded him neutrally, her arm still around Hanska&#x2019;s waist. He cleared his throat. &#x201c;Hello, Wachiwi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is all right?&#x201d; Hanska said to Wachiwi in the tenderest tone he had ever heard from her.<br><br>Wachiwi nodded.</p><h2>Granville Barker Plays: 1: Voysey Inheritance; Waste; The Secret Life; Rococo; Vote by Ballot (World Classics)</h2><p><p>Harley Granville Barker was the most brilliant British director of the first quarter of the twentieth century.

Over the next few years, the senior Dr. Lerner tried to speed the deaths of his seriously ill mother and mother-in-law to spare them further suffering.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br> These stories angered and alarmed the younger Dr. Lerner&#x2014;an internist, historian of medicine, and bioethicist&#x2014;who had rejected physician-based paternalism in favor of informed consent and patient autonomy. <i>The Good Doctor</i> is a fascinating and moving account of how Dr. Lerner came to terms with two very different images of his father: a revered clinician, teacher, and researcher who always put his patients first, but also a physician willing to &#x201c;play God,&#x201d; opposing the very revolution in patients' rights that his son was studying and teaching to his own medical students.<br><br> But the elder Dr. Lerner&#x2019;s journals, which he had kept for decades, showed the son how the father&#x2019;s outdated paternalism had grown out of a fierce devotion to patient-centered medicine, which was rapidly disappearing. And they raised questions: Are paternalistic doctors just relics, or should their expertise be used to overrule patients and families that make&nbsp;ill-advised choices?&nbsp;Does the growing use of personalized medicine&#x2014;in which specific interventions may be best for specific patients&#x2014;change the calculus between autonomy and paternalism? And how can we best use technologies that were invented to save lives but now too often prolong death? In an era of high-technology medicine, spiraling costs, and health-care reform, these questions could not be more relevant. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> As his father slowly died of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, Barron Lerner faced these questions both personally and professionally.&nbsp;He found himself being pulled&nbsp;into his dad&#x2019;s medical care,&nbsp;even though he had criticized his father for making medical decisions for his relatives.&nbsp;Did playing God&#x2014;at least in some situations&#x2014;actually make sense? Did doctors sometimes &#x201c;know best&#x201d;? <br> &nbsp;<br> A timely and compelling story of one family&#x2019;s engagement with medicine over the last half century, <i>The Good Doctor</i> is an important book for those who treat illness&#x2014;and those who struggle to overcome it.</p><p><b>Barron Lerner</b> is the author of four previous books on medicine and a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2019;&nbsp;<i>Well</i> column, TheAtlantic.com, <i>Huffington Post</i>, and several blogs. He lives in Westchester County, New York, and is a bioethicist, historian of medicine, and internist at New York University&#x2019;s Langone School of Medicine.<p>Chapter Two<br> Super Doctor<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> I have written several books on the history of medicine, and I readily admit to having had unrealistic expectations about how many copies of each would be bought. Tuberculosis, breast &nbsp;cancer, and even celebrity patients were less compelling topics than I had anticipated. Still, I had to chuckle when I read of my father&#x2019;s onetime plan to publish a book entitled <i>Consultant, </i>detailing his experiences seeing patients with infectious diseases at the Veterans Administration<br> Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, and other Cleveland medical institutions in the 1960s and 1970s. As my agent could have told him, the subject was too &#x201c;specialized.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, however, my father saved his notes, which not only illuminate his early medical career but also provide a moving depiction of him at the height of his powers, as he was practicing an intense type of medicine that might best be described as all-consuming. My dad provided a crucial service to internists, surgeons, and other physicians by diagnosing the illnesses of their sick patients and then prescribing effective antibiotics. His overarching concern for the physician-patient relationship also shone through in many of the cases that he documented.<br> &nbsp;<br> As an infectious diseases consultant, my father turned out to have a front-row seat to some of the emerging ethical issues&#x2014;such as medical errors and the limits of medical technology&#x2014;that would soon burst forth into the public spotlight. But his approach to these issues remained largely based on paternalism and beneficence: How could and should the doctor help his patient navigate these complicated and often controversial questions? Given his background and training, which stressed &#x201c;Doctor knows best,&#x201d; he could hardly have chosen a different approach.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, I was a fairly typical teenager, trying to balance schoolwork, friends, and jobs. Two important decisions I made during these years were to have a bar mitzvah and to work for two summers at a nursing home at which my father was the medical director. The first represented an important exploration of my Judaism, although, like my father, I had great ambivalence about religion. The second turned out to be a dry run for my becoming a doctor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not all cases of infection require an infectious diseases consultation. Garden-variety pneumonias and urinary tract infections, for example, can be treated with a standard assortment of antibiotics. The task becomes even easier if a culture of the infectious material&#x2014;such as sputum, urine, or blood&#x2014;grows a specific organism. The microbiology laboratory can then test specific drugs against the bacteria in question, simplifying the choice of medication.<br> &nbsp;<br> So when my dad was called in on a case, it was a good bet that it was complicated, either because the source of infection could not be determined or because the choice of antibiotic was unclear. For the most part, my father was happy with this arrangement. Like most&nbsp;physicians, he loved difficult and unusual cases, as they made for interesting discussions in the hospital corridors, on rounds, and at the citywide infectious diseases conferences he inaugurated in Cleveland in the late 1960s. Plus, even though my dad was incredibly busy, being a consultant provided him with considerably more flexibility and independence than his colleagues had, with their regular office hours and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients.<br> &nbsp;<br> A typical case that my father saw in the early 1970s was a man with a lymphoma and an unusual pneumonia whose doctors were deciding whether or not to do a lung biopsy, which would involve opening the man&#x2019;s chest. Deducing that the man had pneumocystis pneumonia, which occurred in immunosuppressed patients and would later become a common malady of the AIDS era, he convinced the team to skip the biopsy and treat the patient empirically&nbsp;with antibiotics. The man recovered completely.<br> So did a teenager with congenital heart disease who had endocarditis. Despite being treated with penicillin, he was still running temperatures as high as 105. The patient&#x2019;s cardiologist was worried because the infection was not getting better, and he consulted a surgeon about replacing the infected heart valve&#x2014;a major operation that the boy might not have survived. Noting that, despite his high temperature, the patient appeared to be improving, my father implored the physicians to hold off on surgery. He added another antimicrobial agent to treat what he thought was a small pneumonia. The patient never required surgery and was cured of both infections.<br> &nbsp;<br> A man with pancreatic cancer had recurrent bacterial blood infections. He had recently become infected with a highly resistant strain of an organism called <i>Serratia. </i>The team was at a loss as to what to do to save the man&#x2019;s life. My father reached into his bag of tricks and suggested trying an older antibiotic, tetracycline, not normally used for this type of blood infection. The patient recovered, although he ultimately died from the cancer.<br> &nbsp;<br> When an eighty-five-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a severe infection of his neck, my father was able to diagnose a condition that was very rare: Ludwig&#x2019;s phlegmon. The infection, which had first been described by German physician Wilhelm Frederick von Ludwig in 1836, had become uncommon in the antimicrobial era but was still featured in infectious diseases textbooks. The infection required drainage of the abscess in the operating room, and my dad scrubbed in for the procedure. The surgeon had so little experience with such cases that he took my father&#x2019;s recommendation that he do an extra-long &#x201c;guillotine incision&#x201d; of the neck to help treat the patient.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad&#x2019;s consult notes, which reflected his intimate knowledge of the diseases in question, were often tutorials for the doctors (and patients) involved. When an elderly man with advanced lung disease continued to have fevers and positive sputum cultures, my father wrote: &#x201c;In patients with chronic restrictive pulmonary disease, who have trouble raising secretions, antibiotic therapy of an acute pulmonary infection leads to bacterial overgrowth of the respiratory secretions.&#x201d; The treatment: stop antibiotics and pound on the man&#x2019;s back four times daily to mobilize his phlegm. It worked.<br> &nbsp;<br> As in this case, my father&#x2019;s successes often resulted from using fewer as opposed to more antibiotics, an approach he had learned early on from Louis Weinstein and one that he would impart to generations of Case Western Reserve medical students, house officers and fellows. One woman with multiple myeloma, who had been admitted repeatedly for infections, had a pneumonia that would not respond to any treatment. Given her overall condition, my dad,&nbsp;thinking it was cruel &#x201c;to put her through any more torture,&#x201d; recommended that antibiotics be withdrawn and the patient made comfortable. The pneumonia, or whatever the lung condition was, resolved.<br> &nbsp;<br> In another case, a woman had severe diarrhea probably related to previous use of an antimicrobial. A visiting professor had seen the patient and recommended &#x201c;massive antibiotic therapy&#x201d; to clear out what he thought was an infection in the intestines. But my father&nbsp;had noticed that in addition to the diarrhea, there was mucus in the stool, indicating that the patient&#x2019;s immune system was already fighting the diarrhea. He recommended stopping all antibiotics and simply giving her sugar water, &#x201c;the way one would treat an infantile diarrhea.&#x201d; The patient recovered over the next several days.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, my father consulted on a man who had been admitted with three weeks of high temperatures from an unclear source, a condition termed <i>fever of unexplained origin </i>(FUO) in a well-known 1961 paper by Paul Beeson and his Yale colleague Robert Petersdorf. With antibiotics, the patient&#x2019;s fevers had come down but had not gone away. My dad convinced his colleagues to avoid any further invasive testing and send the patient home. They agreed, and&nbsp;the temperatures gradually disappeared.<br> So how did my father instinctively know when to be aggressive and when to cut back? He would have cited his clinical expertise, beginning with his years as a medical resident and an infectious&nbsp;diseases fellow in Boston and continuing with his experience as an attending physician in Cleveland. Indeed, after the case described above, he planned to compile a series of his FUO cases, those patients &#x201c;who spontaneously recover without any definitive diagnosis and without ever again getting into trouble.&#x201d; This, after all, was the sort of clinical research that my father did during his years in Cleveland&#x2014;retrospective studies of cases that shared a common&nbsp;characteristic, usually infections caused by a particular rare organism. The research was top-notch and published in excellent, peerreviewed journals. In order to improve his knowledge and conduct his research, my dad diligently tracked down patients who had been discharged, often sending them personal letters.<br> &nbsp;<br> But my father&#x2019;s style of research belonged to an earlier era. By the late 1970s, the randomized clinical trial&#x2014;in which large numbers of patients were enrolled in formal studies and followed&nbsp;prospectively over time&#x2014;had come into ascendancy. Researchers sought major grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and often collaborated at multiple medical centers throughout the country. Only through this type of sophisticated scientific analysis, biostatisticians argued, could true knowledge be obtained. Case studies like those done by my father were interesting but not necessarily representative.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, on any given day at any given hospital, consultants like my dad and Weinstein could amaze colleagues, students, and patients. In one instance, the VA doctors asked my father to see an unusual case of pneumonia that had stumped everyone. But he knew this bacterium well. &#x201c;It was <i>Nocardia</i>,&#x201d; Robert Bonomo, who trained under my dad, told me a few years ago. &#x201c;He came over and nailed it.&#x201d; On another occasion, when several physicians were evaluating acomplicated skin infection, my dad was the only doctor present who knew all the planes of tissue where bacteria could hide. J. Walton Tomford, another Cleveland infectious diseases specialist, fondly recalled attending the citywide conference at which my father and the two other local infectious diseases gurus, Marty McHenry and Manny Wolinsky, had the opportunity to show off their vast knowledge about the field&#x2014;even taking one another on at times. &#x201c;It was<br> like our church and synagogue,&#x201d; Tomford told me. These doctors also loved to visit their colleagues&#x2019; hospitals. In one memorable case, my father asked McHenry to come to the Mount Sinai to convince a very reluctant Orthodox Jewish woman that she needed to have a lung biopsy. When McHenry, a devout Catholic, took out his rosary to pray for the woman, she quickly acquiesced.<br> &nbsp;<br> In another instance, when no source of infection could be found in an older woman with a high fever, my father suggested that an artery along the side of her head&#x2014;which was not at all tender&#x2014;be biopsied to look for inflammation. The medical literature suggested that the condition he was looking for, temporal arteritis, caused only low-grade temperatures in the elderly, but my dad had seen three other cases with high fever. To the surprise of everyone, even my father, the biopsy was positive and the diagnosis was made. &#x201c;This really represents the evolution of a consultant&#x2019;s experience,&#x201d; he subsequently wrote.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once, an internist asked him to see a young woman who had developed a rash on her right forearm several days after receiving the antimicrobial ampicillin for a fever and sore throat. My father saw her at her home because she lived near us. I presume he took with him his black doctor&#x2019;s bag, which he used for his infrequent house calls and which contained the slides, syringes, and other equipment he needed to make a diagnosis. The rash was very distinctive,&nbsp;extending in a linear pattern from her elbow to her wrist. It was petechial&#x2014;that is, composed of small purple spots caused by broken blood vessels. My dad immediately suspected meningococcemia, the severe bacterial blood infection on which his future mentor Weinstein had been lecturing on the day they met in 1960. Employing a bit of showmanship, my father asked the woman if she had recently been playing tennis. Startled, she said that she had, a<br> few days before, around the time she had first seen her internist. He later attributed this feat of clinical acumen to the concept of <i>locus</i> <i>minoris resistentiae </i>(place of least resistance), taught to him by Weinstein. Due to the vigorous motion in the patient&#x2019;s forearm caused by&nbsp;playing tennis, the meningococcal bacteria had preferentially settled there and caused a rash. Before leaving, my dad put a drop of liquid from one of the lesions onto a slide, returned to the hospital, and did his own Gram stain, confirming the diagnosis.<br> &nbsp;<br> In yet another case, my father overruled an &#x201c;excellent internist and competent ophthalmologist&#x201d; and prescribed a low dose of an antileukemia drug for a woman who had shingles that involved her eye. The patient&#x2019;s symptoms dramatically improved by the next morning. The basis of his decision? Observations that he and an infectious diseases colleague at nearby University Hospital had made that, in fact, contradicted a controlled study of the medication that had recently been done at the NIH. &#x201c;Another aspect of the case that is certainly worth commenting on is the beautiful demonstration of the value of a specialist in a given situation,&#x201d; my dad later&nbsp;wrote. &#x201c;This is really a minutia type of therapeutic maneuver and can only come about through word of mouth and personal experience.&#x201d; Although he closely reviewed the results of major clinical trials, he passionately asserted that keen clinical observation remained<br> the most important way to approach illness and care for sick people.<br><br> To what degree was my father truly bucking the trend in medicine that increasingly favored population-based data over clinical intuition? In her 2013 book on Sister Kenny, the famous polio nurse of the 1930s and 1940s, the historian Naomi Rogers argues that Kenny actually constructed an alternative pathophysiological model of the disease based on her personal bedside observations. That is, she rejected the then-current scientific explanations for how polio<br> crippled patients, feeling that the mechanism responsible was the muscle spasms she observed, as opposed to nerve damage. Kenny&#x2019;s novel treatment strategy for polio, which involved mobilizing paralyzed muscles as early as possible, followed directly from her&nbsp;unorthodox perspective. Seeing, in other words, was believing. I encountered this epistemological conundrum when researching breast cancer: certain patients insisted that their cancers were caused by toxic exposures and others assured me that screening mammograms&nbsp;had saved their lives even though controlled-study data indicated that both scenarios were unlikely.<br> &nbsp;<br> Firmly grounded in scientific medicine, my f...</p></p><h2>Stargazers (Holiday House Book)</h2><p>Basic information about stars and constellations.</p><p>Gail Gibbons has published close to fifty distinguished nonfiction titles with Holiday House.

Her website is www.gailgibbons.comGrade 1-3-- A series of star-spattered night skies done in rich blues and purples gives this introduction to the universe and the practice of astronomy an appealing look. A diverse cast--ancient and modern, adults and children, scientists and amateurs--peer through lenses, or point and smile. Gibbons discusses, in short declarative sentences, the nature of stars and constellations, how to find particular ones and why they seem to move, two kinds of optical telescopes, and how a planetarium works, closing with a simple time line and a page of random star facts. As always, her illustrations are simple and clear, even when labels and lines of text are superimposed, or design constraints limit their size. However, she does take on too many topics for such a basic book. Readers are likely to be confused by incomplete explanations of twinkling and the speed of light, or the moonlike object labelled ``star,'' and her unelaborated claim that there are 88 constellations is a severe oversimplification. Still, this makes a good update for Fradin's Astronomy (Childrens, 1983) and a natural gateway to Franklyn Branley's many books. --John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Money Machine</h2><p>When a Secret service agent arrives to investigate their harmless practical joke, two teen-age boys are put on the trail of a gang of counterfeiters.</p><p></p><h2>The Painted Furniture Sourcebook: Motifs from the Medieval Times to the Present Day</h2><p>Painted furniture and interiors expert Annie Sloan leads the enthusiast through a fully illustrated, international spectrum of decorative styles--American colonial, Dutch folk art, Irish vernacular, Scandinavian neoclassical, Oriental lacquerwork, German baroque and more--all achievable by collectors, decorators and do-it-yourselfers.<br><br>For each enchanting room and object, the author reveals how the paint effect was achieved and how to recreate it in the contemporary home.

Influenced by many occupying and neighbouring cultures, Eritrea&#39;s cuisine includes fruits and vegetables brought by the Italians, chili peppers from the Turks, European style beer from the British, a traditional bean stew from the Egyptians, and many staples from Ethiopian cuisine. Here are over 100 easy-to-follow recipes that will allow home chefs to bring a real &#39;taste of Eritrea&#39; to their tables. The author&#39;s informative and insightful introduction, which covers aspects of Eritrean history, culture and traditions, also offers the reader a fascinating look at this lovely country.</p><p><i>Taste of Eritrea</i> provides 100 recipes and a substantial amount of background on this little-known country on the eastern coast of Africa. The cooking of Eritrea shows strong influences from such diverse regions as neighboring Ethiopia, former ruler Italy, Turkey, and England. From Ethiopia comes the use of berber�, a fiery blend of red chilies, garlic, ginger and other aromatic spices; ghee, a kind of clarified butter seasoned with ginger and a distinctive blend of other ingredients, including celery seed and fenugreek; and ingera, a sourdough flatbread made from wheat flour or teff, a local grain. This dish of towel-size, spongy bread is used as both plate and eating utensil by Eritreans. Like the Ethiopians, they eat with their hands, tearing off pieces of this moist bread and using it to convey every bite of food to their mouth. <p> It may seem odd to find pizza and lasagna in an African cookbook, but while few Italians remain in their country, Eritreans still eat spaghetti, drink espresso, and love Macedonia di Frutta, a mixed fruit salad served everywhere. Easy dishes likely to please include Alicha, a mixed vegetable curry; spiced Eritrean Doughnuts; and Doro Zigni, a spicy chicken stew akin to the incendiary wats of Ethiopia.

The paranormal is alive and well in the American cultural landscape. In <em>UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens</em>, Donald R. Prothero and Tim Callahan explore why such demonstrably false beliefs thrive despite decades of education and scientific debunking. Employing the ground rules of science and the standards of scientific evidence, Prothero and Callahan discuss a wide range of topics including the reliability of eyewitness testimony, psychological research into why people want to believe in aliens and UFOs, and the role conspiratorial thinking plays in UFO culture. They examine a variety of UFO sightings and describe the standards of evidence used to determine whether UFOs are actual alien spacecraft. Finally, they consider our views of aliens and the strong cultural signals that provide the shapes and behaviors of these beings.

Coach Pitino was able to turn Louisville into NCAA champions by applying this idea to everything he and the team did-every practice, every recruiting visit, every game preparation, every scouting report, every instruction that he gave players and coaches, and everything he did himself.

Pitino shows how to:</p><p>- Establish focus as a discipline in everything you do: planning, strategy, priorities, and career advancement.</p><p>- Discover the true key to success: not ambition, not wealth, not power, but humility.</p><p>- Use technology wisely-but don't let it replace personal connection with the people you work and live with.</p><p>- Own up to your problems, tell the truth and they will become part of your past. Lie and they become part of your future.</p><p>- Make small changes and add value to every minute of your life.</p><p><i>The One-Day Contract</i> will reshape the way you approach your job, your goals, and your life.</p></p><p><p>RICK PITINO is the head basketball coach at the University of Louisville.

There are victories to talk about, stories to tell, and lessons to learn. Humility is not even a basketball word. You might ask, where does this guy, or any basketball coach, get off talking about humility? I agree that humility is scarce in the athletic world. Egos run rampant, as much on the sidelines as on the court. The egotistical coach, the arrogant athlete, they are stereotypes that too often ring true. <br>Here at the outset of this book, you should understand that there are two ways to handle subjects as a coach or teacher. You can teach people or try to help them from showing them how you succeeded, or you can allow them to see and learn from your failures. The former is much more fun. But the latter often is more instructive. In this book, I not only will talk about successes and how they came about, but failures, too, in the hope that both sides will be helpful for some; because we all come up short at some point. <br>I was not a picture of humility for much of my career. That is one reason I want to talk about it first. The other reason is this: Without humility, no other principle or lesson I talk about in this book will hit home. It is the key to everything that follows. <br>When our players came back to campus before school started for the 2012&#x2013;13 season, I knew there was a great danger of becoming complacent or resting on the success of having made the Final Four the previous April. When we got the team together, the theme of my first discussion in our first meeting was humility. It was the theme of my first speech to our fan base during our annual Tipoff Luncheon in October. And it was the last word I wrote on the board after every victory through our entire season, right through the NCAA championship game. For our team, humility was the key to staying focused and to keeping a winning mind-set, as well as the key to accepting setbacks and turning them to positives. Most of our players embraced the lesson of humility, which is a remarkable thing for a group of young people. <br>It was more than the key for our players. It was the key for me. The longer I live and the more I experience, the more I believe that humility is the quality essential to sustained success, and a lack of it is the major stumbling block for those who find success for a time, then lose it. I&#x2019;m not claiming to have perfected the trait, but I have learned its importance, and am learning to let it take root in my life and work. The lesson of humility comes to everyone eventually. Either you learn its value, or life drills it into you&#x2014;and life can be a painful teacher. It is a lesson best learned before life makes you another case study. Let me give you an example: myself. <br>We all have our share of personal regrets. My greatest professional regret might surprise you. It wasn&#x2019;t leaving the University of Kentucky and walking into my first professional failure with the Boston Celtics. Failure is not final, and I always have said it is fertilizer for future success. No, my great regret from a professional standpoint is that I was not humbler at an earlier age. Here is how it worked for me. My early coaching career was a succession of surprising rebuilding jobs, each more celebrated than the one before. My first head coaching job was at Boston University. The team had won seventeen games combined in the two years before I arrived and hadn&#x2019;t had a winning season in fifteen years. Within five years we had made the NCAA Tournament. After working as an assistant coach to Hubie Brown for the New York Knicks, I took over as head coach at Providence College, which had just finished a 12&#x2013;20 season. In my second season, we went to a Final Four. The next season I had a dream job, head coach of the New York Knicks. For a kid who grew up just eight blocks from Madison Square Garden, at 26th Street, it was as much as I could ask for. They&#x2019;d won just twenty-four games the year before. In my second season, we won the franchise&#x2019;s first Eastern Division championship in nearly two decades. <br>From there it was on to the Roman Empire of college basketball, the University of Kentucky. We took a program famously crippled by NCAA probation and were back in the Final Four in four years, and won a national title in six. Professionally, everything I touched seemed to be turning into gold. <br>Over the course of that time, I developed a feeling that much of that success was about me and what I was doing. It was difficult not to feel that way. There&#x2019;s no question when you coach at Kentucky, you fall into a trap of thinking you&#x2019;re much better than you really are, because of the adulation and attention. It is constant and seems to come in a never-ending supply. I did not know it in the midst of it, but that arrogance, that thinking of yourself as the best, is one of the biggest reasons successful people stumble and fail. It helped lead me into an error, but it was a fortunate one. <br>I was very lucky to have left that atmosphere when I did. I look back at my time at Kentucky and realize I didn&#x2019;t carry myself with the humility necessary to foster more lasting relationships. Thankfully, I was able to build some with several remarkable people, anyway, that remain to this day. Because I left when I did, after being on top for some great years, I had a good ending. Most Kentucky coaches have not. Adolph Rupp didn&#x2019;t; he was in a fierce battle to keep coaching. Joe B. Hall retired under fire despite winning a national title and reaching three Final Fours. Eddie Sutton left in turmoil. Tubby Smith never got his just credit for the outstanding job he did. His major problem was winning the championship too soon. So for me, leaving Kentucky personally wasn&#x2019;t a bad thing. I recognized that I was falling into a trap with all that adulation; but I really didn&#x2019;t understand completely the consequences until I failed with the Celtics. If I hadn&#x2019;t left, I might not have learned that important lesson of humility. Instead, the experience taught me a great deal and I emerged from my time in Boston with the knowledge that I needed to live my life more humbly. I retained that knowledge, but from time to time I would forget it, or not put it into practice, much to my dismay and detriment, which I will discuss during this book. <br>The consequences of not learning humility can be tragic. If we don&#x2019;t always see these consequences in our own lives, we should be able to recognize them all around us. Not learning humility is, for one thing, an expensive lesson. In 2009, <i>Sports Illustrated</i> estimated that 60 percent of NBA players are broke within five years after their playing careers are over, and 78 percent of NFL players are facing serious financial distress just two years after their retirement. Others might tell you it&#x2019;s a lack of discipline or poor financial advice that brings this about. I&#x2019;m convinced that more than anything else, in most of these cases, it&#x2019;s a deficit of humility. <br>Look at the headlines to see examples of people with great talent who fail in many ways. What usually isn&#x2019;t in the headlines or the stories is the root cause of their failure. People could see it coming for Terrell Owens, the onetime dominant receiver of the National Football League, the player who at the top of his game once said, &#x201c;I love me some me!&#x201d; Here was a guy who once caught a touchdown pass over two defenders, grabbed a marker from someone behind the end zone, autographed a ball, and then tossed it to one of his financial advisors. The flamboyant celebrations, the constant need to be in the spotlight even off the field, the brash pronouncements, these are typical of the kind of arrogance displayed in all areas of life today, even if Owens is an extreme example. As high as he was riding&#x2014;and he made $80 million from 2000 to 2010&#x2014;Owens took wild financial risks. He made questionable real estate deals. He lost $2 million in an electronic bingo venture in Alabama, an investment that not only was made on an illegal enterprise, but in violation of NFL gambling rules. In 2011, with his football performance sliding, he went to a judge in Georgia asking the court to reduce his support payments to the four mothers of his four children. His Georgia home was in foreclosure. In January of 2012, he told <i>GQ</i> magazine that to anyone who texts him asking him where he is, he responds with a three-word message, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in hell.&#x201d; Yet he still was not heeding life&#x2019;s call to humility. <br>This is a story that is repeated with painful regularity. The mistakes Owens made, while on a much larger scale, perhaps, are mistakes that many make. NFL player Adam &#x201c;Pacman&#x201d; Jones recently told a gathering of incoming league rookies that he once blew a million dollars in a single weekend. Beside him on the stage, Owens remarked, &#x201c;Man, you crazy.&#x201d; And if Terrell Owens calls you crazy, you can take it to the bank. Self-aggrandizement, alienation of friends, family, or teammates, a tragic tendency to overestimate one&#x2019;s talent that leads to overreaching, they all are traits of people who lack humility. <br>This also is a story that is not new. The ancient Greeks had a word for this very situation: hubris. It means extreme confidence or arrogance to the point that one loses touch with reality and overestimates one&#x2019;s abilities. Often in Greek mythology and drama, their heroes would have great success, only to demonstrate hubris, bite off more than they could chew, and be laid low. The Greeks took this concept so seriously that hubris was a crime in ancient Athens. To humiliate a defeated foe was a crime. <br>Today, it is commonplace. NFL receivers aren&#x2019;t the only ones who fall into the trap. Some of the most insecure people are movie stars. To see the Mel Gibsons of the world achieve such stunning success, believe they cannot fail, and then be brought low out of arrogance and lack of humility is becoming a frequent narrative. Nowhere is it more personified than in Charlie Sheen. His reckless behavior, combined with a complete refusal to honestly assess himself, led him to assert that he was &#x201c;winning&#x201d; even as he was losing stature and face in the entertainment world, not to mention the leading role on a top-rated television show he had helped build. That he capitalized on his runaway arrogance with a so-called comedy tour shouldn&#x2019;t obscure the truth. What he achieved was not true success, but mere notoriety, and not even the best kind. By failing to embrace humility and clinging in desperation to his own arrogance and misplaced belief in himself, Sheen continued the cycle of self-destruction that was leading to his problems. The same cycle can be seen in many fields, from business leaders who saw no limits to their income or luxuries, to politicians who thought they were on a roll that could not be stopped, only to be run out of office. The list of those for whom humility not only might have saved a fortune, but their future, is long and star-studded. <br>I can see how it worked in my life. Whether it was Boston University, the Knicks, Providence, or Kentucky, every downtrodden program I took over turned around dramatically. So when I looked at the situation with the Boston Celtics, who were to get two of the top six picks in the upcoming NBA Draft Lottery, why would it be any different? Because I lacked humility, I just couldn&#x2019;t accept the possibility that I had only a 28 percent chance of getting the best-case scenario, the No. 1 and No. 2 picks. Of course I would get those picks, I reasoned. If I had been humbler, if I had been more aware of where my success came from, I would have looked at that situation and understood that the team was over the salary cap, that the odds were against getting Tim Duncan, the best player in that year&#x2019;s draft, and that it was not the great opportunity I was making it out to be. I might still have gone to the NBA, but it would have been a different job, had I understood better why you win. A lack of humility clouded my judgment. <br>Lacking humility makes you overextend. It makes you feel immune not only from common consequences, but sometimes the law. Mike Tyson spent time in jail, and then lost his considerable fortune because of a ridiculous lifestyle of consumption and surrounding himself with bad advisors. People who lack humility often do this. Rather than surround themselves with more talented people with whom they would have to share credit and success, they pick the wrong people, and rarely share the credit. Show me a chief executive officer who keeps all of a $20 million bonus instead of passing some of it along to his fellow executives, and I&#x2019;ll show you someone who lacks humility, and is heading for a fall. Humility forces you to treat people around you better, to share with people, to carry them with you in any success you have. Humble people do that. That&#x2019;s why you see people like John Wooden, maybe the greatest coach of all time in any sport, or Mike Krzyzewski, who is the modern-day John Wooden, sustain success for so long. You can readily see their humility. That doesn&#x2019;t mean they don&#x2019;t have flaws, don&#x2019;t get angry or make mistakes. Everybody does. But the key that opens up all the greatness is humility. <br>Read this list of athletes who have filed for bankruptcy, and consider the cost of not learning this valuable lesson: Warren Sapp, Dennis Rodman, Allen Iverson, Mike Tyson, Marion Jones, Lawrence Taylor, Antoine Walker, Latrell Sprewell, Evander Holyfield, Michael Vick, Travis Henry, Lenny Dykstra, Kenny Anderson, and Leon Spinks. And that list is far from complete. <br>Even for those whom it doesn&#x2019;t ruin financially, a lack of humility can bring other difficulties. In every player I have coached who has not reached his potential on and off the court, the common missing element in his life and attitude is humility. The overspending, buying ten watches, the decadent lifestyle, the entourages, the unrealistic expectation of their own stature and longevity&#x2014;all this leads to poor choices and reckless decision making. There are many athletes who believe that because they are invincible at times on the court, it will spill over into other areas. This is a crucial misjudgment, and it all stems from a lack of humility. So many athletes I&#x2019;ve coached are struggling right now. Every day, I hope they will find humility and become more like Jamal Mashburn, who was the opposite. He never thought he was good enough, and worked every day to get better. He wasn&#x2019;t a so-called McDonald&#x2019;s All-American, and he felt hard work and a willingness to listen to every suggestion for improvement were his road map to success. Jamal seemed to have a blueprint for how humility works in athletics. He was one of the most popular and respected players in University of Kentucky history. People sensed his humble spirit and were drawn to him. Jamal knew how to save and develop a lifestyle that was healthy and humble for his family. He also invested wisely for his future. Today he is the CEO of a Lexus/Toyota dealership and currently owns pieces of franchises with Papa John&#x2019;s, Outback Steakhouse, and Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts, and no one outside his inner circle would even know it. I only wish Jamal would serve as an example for all my players, not only in how to act, but how to develop a successful life down the road. <br>A lack of humility can damage your influence on others. As I watched New York Jets coach Rex Ryan go about his brash predictions, including guaranteeing a victory in the 2012 AFC Championship game, it just blew me away&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m from New York! I was confused about why he was do...</p><h2>A Case of Vineyard Poison</h2><p>Ex-cop J.W.

Craig is associate professor of English at Wheelock College in Boston.Reading the sixth Vineyard mystery starring ex-cop J.W. Jackson and nurse Zee Madeiras, his fiancee, is like spending a day at the beach with close, bantering friends. One weekend, Zee's ATM spits out a receipt that shows her bank account is $100,000 fatter than it should be; the following Monday, the money is gone. Everyone, including the bank, thinks it's just a computer glitch. But then J.W. finds a dead female college student in his driveway. It turns out that she was poisoned and that she had recently withdrawn a hundred grand from her bank account. Naturally, J.W. smells something fishy besides the bluefish he periodically reels in. While investigating both the floating funds and the poisoned coed, J.W. plays host to a world-famous pianist and talks a lot about making dinner, which he usually thoroughly enjoys. Although the plot relies on incredible coincidence to give J.W. a vital clue, Craig captains a pleasurable little junket with his Martha's Vineyard crew. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Original Guitar Case Scale Book: Compact Reference Library</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Reprint.</p><p>The hero of Daniel Woodrell's <i>Tomato Red</i> is the most endearingly out-of-control loser you're likely to meet. Sammy Barlach looks like a person "who should in any circumstances be considered a suspect"; clerks follow him through the supermarket when he shops, and the police pull him over simply from habit. But in spite of his looks, Sammy only wants to be loved, even if it's just by "the bunch that would have me"--and in the hardscrabble world of West Table, Missouri, that's a bunch you wouldn't necessarily want to meet. The novel begins with a heady Methedrine rush, as Sammy celebrates payday by letting himself be talked into robbing a nearby mansion. Even when his newfound friends disappear as he's breaking in, he persists: "You might think I should've quit on the burglary right there, but I just love people, I guess, and didn't." The break-in leads Sammy into an unlikely alliance with the Merridew family: Jamalee and Jason and their mother Bev, a prostitute in the town's ironically named Venus Holler. Flame-haired Jamalee dreams constantly of a different kind of life, and she plans on using Jason's extraordinary beauty as her ticket out of West Table. Jason, however, seems to be shaping up as what Sammy calls "country queer"--which, as Sammy observes, "ain't the easiest walk to take amongst your throng of fellow humankind."<p> Unfortunately for Jamalee, Woodrell's Ozarks is a place that rewards ambition with disaster. Here as in his five previous "country <i>noir</i>" novels, Woodrell writes with a keen understanding of class and a barely contained sense of rage. The residents of West Table's trailer parks and shotgun shacks share Sammy's sense of limited possibilities. "<i>I ain't shit! I ain't shit!</i> shouts your brain," Sammy thinks while wandering around the mansion, "and this place proves the point." Even when Jason sticks up for his own family, the way he does so is heartbreaking: "This expression of utter frankness takes over Jason's beautiful face, and he says, 'I don't think we're the <i>lowest</i> scum in town.' He didn't argue that we weren't scum, just disputed our position on the depth chart." With her mildewing etiquette guides and grandiose plans, Jamalee is the only character who doesn't share their sense of defeat, and she's the only one who, in the end, gets away--though she leaves behind her a trail of betrayal and heartache. By the time the novel's final tragedy rolls around, it seems both senseless and inevitable, as tragedies do in real life. Told in a voice that crackles with energy and wit, <i>Tomato Red</i> is sharp, funny, and more importantly, true. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Daniel Woodrell is the author of six acclaimed novels, including <i>Muscle for the Wing</i>, <i>Give Us a Kiss</i> and <i>Woe to Live On</i>, which became the recent film <i>Ride with the Devil</i>, directed by Ang Lee.

Parker, the author of the celebrated Spenser novels.Dashiell Samuel Hammett was born in St. Mary&#x2019;s County. He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett left school at the age of fourteen and held several kinds of jobs thereafter&#x2014;messenger boy, newsboy, clerk, operator, and stevedore, finally becoming an operative for Pinkerton&#x2019;s Detective Agency. Sleuthing suited young Hammett, but World War I intervened, interrupting his work and injuring his health. When Sergeant Hammett was discharged from the last of several hospitals, he resumed detective work. He soon turned to writing, and in the late 1920s Hammett became the unquestioned master of detective-story fiction in America. In <b>The Maltese Falcon</b> (1930) he first introduced his famous private eye, Sam Spade. <b>The Thin Man</b> (1932) offered another immortal sleuth, Nick Charles. <b>Red Harvest</b> (1929), <b>The Dain Curse</b> (1929), and <b>The Glass Key</b> (1931) are among his most successful novels. During World War II, Hammett again served as sergeant in the Army, this time for more than two years, most of which he spent in the Aleutians. Hammett&#x2019;s later life was marked in part by ill health, alcoholism, a period of imprisonment related to his alleged membership in the Communist Party, and by his long-time companion, the author Lillian Hellman, with whom he had a very volatile relationship. His attempt at autobiographical fiction survives in the story &#x201c;Tulip,&#x201d; which is contained in the posthumous collection <b>The Big Knockover</b> (1966, edited by Lillian Hellman). Another volume of his stories, <b>The Continental Op</b> (1974, edited by Stephen Marcus), introduced the final Hammett character: the &#x201c;Op,&#x201d; a nameless detective (or &#x201c;operative&#x201d;) who displays little of his personality, making him a classic tough guy in the hard-boiled mold&#x2014;a bit like Hammett himself.</p><h2>Narrative Therapy: Responding to Your Questions</h2><p>If you are trying to engage with narrative practices in your therapy or community work then this easy-to-read and yet thorough and rigorous book has been created with you in mind.

Several decades later Xinran met Shu Wan, a Chinese woman who had spent years searching for her missing husband who had been serving as a doctor in Tibet; her extraordinary life story would unravel the legend of the sky burial. For thirty years she was lost in the wild and alien landscape of Tibet, in the vast and silent plateaus and the magisterial mountain ranges, living with communities of nomads moving with the seasons and struggling to survive.<br><br>In this haunting book, Xinran recreates Shu Wen's remarkable journey in an epic story of love, loss, loyalty and survival. Moving, shocking and, ultimately, uplifting <i>Sky Burial</i> paints a unique portrait of a woman and a land, both at the mercy of fate and politics.</p><p>In the world of fiction reviewing, extraordinary is an over-used word. Yet there really is no other way to describe Chinese author Xinran's second book, <i>Sky Burial</i>. It is extraordinary in so many ways--the subject matter, the setting, the central character, but mostly its authenticity and the author's continuing search for the woman whose life is told here.<p> <i>Sky Burial</i> is the true story of a Chinese woman's 30-year search through Tibet for news of her lost, presumed dead, husband. Xinran is working as a radio journalist on a women's programme when a listener calls in to tell her about Shuwen. Xinran travels hundreds of miles across China to interview her and, over two days, Shuwen opens her heart and reveals her tragic, scarcely imaginable life story. Xinran returns to her life and spends the subsequent 10 years trying to find Shuwen again, researching her story and writing this book--a homage to an ordinary woman's extraordinary life-long search for the truth.</p><p> The story is a simple one: Shuwen meets her intelligent, idealistic husband-to-be while they are both training to be doctors. After less than 100 days of marriage, Kejun travels to Tibet as a Chinese army doctor and before long, Shuwen is notified that he has died in an "incident". Shuwen decides to join the army herself, travel to Tibet and find out if he really is dead, and if so, how and why he died. </p><p> And then, as if travelling to a closed country like Tibet as a young woman in the 1950s is not difficult enough, Shuwen quickly becomes separated from her unit and, close to death herself, is taken in by a family of Tibetan nomads. Her transformation from Chinese doctor to nomadic Buddhist is a long, painful and at many turns, deeply distressing one. </p><p> <i>Sky Burial</i> is a slight book--little more than an extended short story--and yet the ground it covers is immense, not just because of the fascinating glimpse it offers into a land and a people still largely unknown in the West. Despite its tragic themes of loss and survival in one of the world's harshest landscapes, it is an uplifting tale of unwavering loyalty and immeasurable inner strength. --<i>Carey Green</i></p>"A romantic epic of loss and redemption, of stoic constancy in the face of the vagaries of fate" (<i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"Part family story, part mystical adventure in an alien culture, it's like <i>Wild Swans </i>crossed with <i>Seven Years in Tibet</i>" (<i>Cond� Nast Traveller</i>)<br><br>"This little-known culture has been brought vividly to life through the incredible love story of Shu Wen.

While little is known about Akeley's childhood and Akeley himself did little writing, Bodry-Sanders has incorporated rich descriptions and interesting stories from his family and colleagues to create a portrait of a man full of drive and ambition. In showing how this visionary man of many talents and accomplishments came to be so closely associated with all that is African, she does a superb job of demonstrating the familial, social, and environmental forces that combined to ensure success in Akeley's life.

She lives in New York City.Starred Review. Pakula, an experienced biographer of royal women (<i>An Uncommon Woman: The Empress Frederick</i>), looks at the imperious (if not imperial) wife of the Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, presenting a richly complex account of 20th-century China that, despite its length, remains thoroughly engrossing to the end. Born May-ling Soong (1897&#x2013;2003) and educated in America, Madame Chiang and her five Soong siblings were wealthy, Christian, fluent in English and major players in Chinese politics. Marrying Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, the strong-minded and hot-tempered, shrewd and ruthless May-ling quickly became a partner in his efforts as Chinese leader until the Japanese invaded, and then in 1945 when Mao's Communists drove him to Formosa (modern-day Taiwan), which he ruled until his death in 1975. From the 1930s to 1950s, Americans idolized Madame Chiang as a symbol of Chinese resistance to the brutal Japanese and as an anticommunist stalwart. But critics of her and Chiang's ineffective, authoritarian, corrupt leadership soon became the majority. Pakula draws a vivid if often unflattering portrait of a charismatic Chinese patriot, her husband and family, in tumultuous and tragic times. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos; maps. <i>(Nov. 13)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is regarded as one of the key figures of 19th-century literary realism. He was the son of Henry James, Sr. and the brother of philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James. He is best known for a number of novels showing Americans encountering Europe and Europeans. His method of writing from a character&#x2019;s point of view allowed him to explore issues related to consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and unreliable narrators brought a new depth to narrative fiction. James contributed significantly to literary criticism, particularly in his insistence that writers be allowed the greatest possible freedom in presenting their view of the world. James claimed that a text must first and foremost be realistic and contain a representation of life that is recognisable to its readers. Good novels, to James, show life in action and are, most importantly, interesting. In addition to his voluminous works of fiction he published articles and books of travel, biography, autobiography, and criticism, and wrote plays. James alternated between America and Europe for the first twenty years of his life; eventually he settled in England, becoming a British subject in 1915, one year before his death. James was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912, and 1916.</p><p></p><h2>An Evening with Marilyn</h2><p>Perhaps it was her girlish, whispery voice; or the way her eyes danced when she smiled; or how she seemed to have an unearthly glow about her. Whatever the reason, Marilyn Monroe remains one of the most glamorous, seductive, and charming women in Hollywood history. Worshipped for her sexuality, adored for her vulnerability and innocence, Marilyn is a celebrated movie icon whose persona continues to enthrall and delight her loyal fans. Marilyn&#x2019;s ethereal beauty and irrepressible charisma are captured here in a sequence of sensual portraits taken over the course of one extraordinary evening in 1961 when she was thirty-five, just a year before her tragic death. On assignment for Look magazine to photograph the movie star for its twenty-fifth anniversary cover, Douglas Kirkland shot Marilyn in the intimate confines of an unmade bed. The result is a series of some of the most spontaneous and flirtatious photographs ever taken of this film legend. Moody, grainy, and evocative, these images are accompanied by Kirkland&#x2019;s own recounting of the story behind the photo shoot. Together his words and pictures tell the seductive tale of a brief and unforgettable encounter between a handsome freshman photographer and the sexiest woman in Hollywood history.</p><p>Sleekly designed and accented with playful pink type, An Evening with Marilyn is the perfect gift book for the contemporary Marilyn enthusiast, fan, or collector.

Within hours of the earthquake, the people of Berkeley began to organize a citizens' committee, knowing that terrified masses of stricken refuges would pour into their town within hours. By revisiting both their challenges&#x2014;smallpox, fires, and keeping public order&#x2014;and acts of grace, such as taking in the homeless, setting up temporary camps, and dispensing food, Richard Schwartz illuminates a nearly forgotten episode in Bay Area history. Containing many breathtaking photos and illustrations not seen for nearly one hundred years, this new visual history offers up singularly human details of one of the nation's most infamous disasters.</p><p>Earthquake Exodus, 1906 unveils a history of the refugees of San Francisco who fled to Berkeley and the ten-week relief effort that followed. In its day these events were monumental but were forgotten within a generation. Historian Richard Schwartz has plumbed the depths of these events and offers up stories, details and subtleties of the relief period like a feast. One of the most notable facets that comes out of his research is how no one waited for the government to take over, organize or support the efforts. This book will serve us very well. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom (from a Certificate of Honor entrusted to Richard Schwartz to present to Mayor Tom Bates on April 18, 2006) "...I am pleased to recognize and honor the selfless contributions of the people of the City of Berkeley on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Great Earthquake of 1906. The Relief and assistance the Berkeley community gave to San Franciscans after the earthquake was invaluable to the reconstruction of our City. Thank you!" Dr. Gray Brechin, Geographer and author of Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin."...On April 17, 1906, the university town had twenty-six thousand residents. A year later, it had grown by half again to thirty-eight thousand, largely due to the influx of homeless refugees fleeing the afflicted city. Schwartz explains how Berkeleyans generously responded by setting up temporary camps, dispensing food, listing jobs, and even taking in the homeless. He details the measures taken to ensure public order and health as city and university officials struggled to deal with thousands of disoriented, impoverished, and sometimes dangerous strangers, many separated from their loved ones&amp;emdash;everyday details long forgotten but worth study by those who wish to better prepare for the next great shake." Earthquake Exodus, 1906 is listed as a resource book on the UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library website- "The 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire Digital Collection." "A beautiful gem... and I know what goes into making a book." Malcolm Margolin, Heyday Books "Superb..." Phil Wood, owner Ten Speed Press "There will be many books this year to mark the 100th anniversary... EARTHQUAKE EXODUS, 1906 is one of the best and perhaps the most unique...His account is often vivid in detail and even thrilling...Schwartz provides in astonishing detail...thus making the book amazingly useful for today's reader or researcher. EARTHQUAKE EXODUS, 1906 will certainly be one of the basic works in the history of the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake and fire...Bravo Richard Schwartz!" Harlan Kessel, Alameda County Historical Society "...more important than the amazing visual feast Schwartz provides us with the stories he retrieved from the "dust bin of history." ...we are so enriched by Schwartz having saved them....and are inevitably drawn to comparing it to our own response to the Katrina disaster, we are sobered and wish to read more to glean the simple secrets of their success.This book is a gift to the citizens of 2006 of the Bay Area and beyond, just as the citizens of 1906 gave their gift to the refugees...Schwartz has done it again and we suggest you partake in reclaiming this monumental and thoroughly forgotten Bay Area history.Earthquake Exodus, 1906, Berkeley Responds to the San Francisco Refugees is a work of art and masterful history telling. We guarantee you will feel proud, good and better prepared after reading it." Nilda Rego, Moraga Historical Society "An amazing new book... literally brought to life again the people whose stories capture their moment... a remarkable job of research and it takes one who has done it, to know how truly remarkable it is." Burl Willis, author, historian, winner of the Governor's History Book Award Earthquake Exodus, 1906, celebrates a largely unknown chapter from the aftermath of the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Containing many breathtaking photos and illustrations never before published or unseen in nearly 100 years, this new visual history is breathtaking. Berkeley Voice columnist Martin Snapp writes, "even more compelling than the photos are the hundreds of stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things." In the story of the relief effort, instigated within hours of the earthquake, the ordinary and extraordinary people of Berkeley began to organize a committee, knowing that terrified masses of stricken refugees would be pouring into their town within hours. As author Schwartz says, "They didn't wait for government. They didn't wait for money. They didn't wait for instructions." DID YOU KNOW � that many people fled to the Berkeley hills the first night of the quake and a number of women died there giving birth? � that Asian refugees were segregated in their own camps and sections of town and that even the embassy of China inspected their plight and did not complain? � smallpox erupted in Berkeley during the relief effort? �industrial West Berkeley, filled with a working class immigrant population, actually caught fire after the earthquake? "Schwartz explains how Berkeleyans generously responded by setting up temporary camps, dispensing food, listing jobs, and even taking in the homeless. He details the measures taken to ensure public order and health as city and university officials struggled to deal with thousands of disoriented, impoverished, and sometimes dangerous strangers, many separated from their loved ones&amp;emdash; everyday details long forgotten but worth study by those who wish to better prepare for the next great shake."

She wrote and produced for radio in the days women were expected to stay at home, receiving awards against conglomerate giants. Television was a new medium at the time, and she jumped right into it, writing, producing, and directing travel documentaries for the Texas Highway Department, writing and producing a traffic courtroom series, and establishing radio/TV workshops. The biggest accomplishment in her film life was when she wrote, directed, and produced a fivescreen film, the first of its type.

He was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. Influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. He was a member of CIAM (Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne) in the 1950s. He did not join the group of younger CIAM architects known as Team X, though his 1960 Tokyo Bay plan was influential for Team 10 in the 1960s, as well as the group that became Metabolism. His university studies on urbanism put him in an ideal position to handle redevelopment projects after the Second World War. His ideas were explored in designs for Tokyo and Skopje. Tange's work influenced a generation of architects across the world. During the 1970s and 1980s Tange expanded his portfolio to include buildings in over 20 countries around the world. In 1985, at the behest of Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris at that time, Tange proposed a master plan for a plaza at Place d'Italie that would interconnect the city along an east-west axis. For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime exemplar of the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of B�ton brut concrete finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.</p><p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Emily&#39;s vinegar diet book.</h2><p>Used.

His prized possession is a string of 100 pearls, 99 of them flawless and 1 small and imperfect. He is lacking only a queen and orders his nephew, Prince Nils, to find him a perfect bride. Nils returns with Blanzeflor, a lovely and kind young woman willing to marry King Hendrik so that her father won't starve. The king gives her the pearls, warning that the day they are not around her neck will be her last. She finds that she cannot bear to see her people suffer, and one by one the pearls are sent to help them. When they are all gone, Blanzeflor is sentenced to death, but the birds she has cared for and who witnessed her kindness rescue her and destroy the king. Langton's narrative is powerful and precise, with a stately cadence. There is nothing extraneous in the tale, as each detail is set carefully into place. Blanzeflor is strong and independent as well as good. The strength and earthiness of Plume's illustrations are balanced by the ethereal quality of the colors and finely sketched details. The artist has also worked traditional Swedish motifs into decorations at the top of each verso. An appended source note discusses the original author and Langton's modifications. A handsome and appealing book.<br><i>Donna L. Scanlon, Lancaster County Library, PA</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3-5. Based on a Swedish literary fairy tale, <i>Drottingens halsband</i>, this lengthy, yet brisk retelling features cruel King Hendrik who orders his nephew Prince Nils to find him a bride worthy to wear his beautiful necklace of 100 pearls. Kind and gentle, his new queen, Blanzeflor, can not stand the suffering of her poor subjects. So, one by one, she gives away the beautiful pearls to alleviate their ills. But when her cruel husband discovers her "treachery," he demands her head--and that of her ally, the prince. Magically, friendly birds appear with the pearls, then they savagely kill the king. A picture book for older readers, this features art that is airy and light in color, though stiff in execution, with a Scandinavian heroine who is mature and robust. Includes a detailed note. <i>Julie Corsaro</i></p><h2>Greatest Magical Stories</h2><p><p><b>Award-winning children's writer and former United Kingdom Children's Laureate Michael Morpurgo has collected the greatest magical stories and put them all together for your reading pleasure.</b></p>From tiny heroes and talking frogs to meddling fairies and mysterious sea creatures, all the wonders of the magical world are right here.

They are the powerhouses of our cells, essential for the production and management of energy at cell level. Dr Sarah Myhill, together with Dr John McLaren Howard of Acumen Laboratories and Dr Norman Booth of Mansfield College Oxford, has spent many years studying the relationship between their malfunction and the commonest problem seen by GPs in the UK - fatigue. Their research findings have been published in three scientific papers in the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, in 2009, 2012 and 2013. These studies showed that poor functioning of the mitochondria is the central problem in CFS. Patients with the worst mitochondrial function had the worst fatigue and vice versa. This is solid scientific evidence that CFS is a problem with mitochondria and has allowed the objective measurement of fatigue for the first time. With the publication of the third study, which showed that mitochondrial function tests and symptoms improved in patients who took measures to address their mitochondrial problems, Dr Myhill was ready to write this book. Here she explains the importance of healthy mitochondria, how we can measure their functioning and what we can do to keep them healthy, or restore them to health if problems arise.

These 30 recipes for special finishing, shaping, baking, and molding techniques will magically transform polymer's appearance. Craft gorgeous faux gemstones, including tiger eye, jade, or malachite. Fool the eye with imitation metals: pewter, Balinese silver, verdigris copper, even rusted steel. The must-have naturals are here, from bone to leather. Or make simulated agate, slate, or marble. You'll find information on all the types of polymer clay, from translucent ones to some with mica powder, and see how to use paints, inks, wax compounds, and confetti to enhance the surface. Among the unusual projects:: a handsome makeup set, lapis lazuli drawer pulls, Opal Earrings, and more.<br></p><p>In her introduction to this well-designed craft book, Dean promises to give readers recipes for an impressive array of imitation effects that use polymer clay, and her book does not disappoint. Each surface is extremely convincing, whether it appears to be bone, malachite, lapis lazuli, tiger-eye, leather, marble or one of the other 30 surfaces shown. The book first presents instructions and photos that show the process of creating a particular surface, then provides a separate project for each effect. The instructions are thorough, and many of these processes are painstaking, involving up to a dozen steps or more. But the end results dazzle, such as the pewter wine stoppers, which look both colonial and new due to clever design, or the cork switch plate, an amusing and relatively easy home accent. Other projects are candlesticks, jewelry, picture frames and similar small items. The book ends with an inspiring gallery of work in polymer crafted by the artists who have shared their techniques and designs with Dean. However, this is not a book for beginners. All of the techniques require an excellent knowledge of working with polymer clay, as well as a budget that can afford purchasing specific tools and materials, such as a pasta machine. (Though Dean says you don't have to have one, she uses one in every recipe.) Readers who qualify will rush to add this volume to their collection.

This is the sign of signs in a writer's reputation. It means he's been acknowledged as one of the authentic voices of his generation, a writer to whom readers and critics alike turn to discover how they feel. The four novellas and two stories of The Last Worthless Evening deepen Dubus's hold on his material, and so are bound to lengthen that frequently debated list of his "best" among his advocates. <br><br>The range in this new book is greater than in any previous Dubus collection. The novellas begin in the Navy, where two young officers (one white, one black) discover each other on the changing terrain of residual racism; offer shrewd homage to the detective story in Dubus's patented territory northwest of Boston; move on to the life of a suburban girl coming beautifully of age as her mother doesn't; and finish with a magnificent defense of her life and children by a woman who refuses defeat at the hands of her brutal and pathetic husband. The stories tell about a Hispanic shortstop lost among the gringos on a major-league team, and show what happens to an eleven-year-old kid when he meets up with a broken, angry, and decidedly dangerous Vietnam vet who takes him into a local bar for a treat.</p><p>The four novellas and two stories in this collection all demonstrate Dubus's belief in the inherent nobility of the individual, the possibility of taking good, moral action on a small scale. And in each, the immediacy and strength of his writing renders the small universal; the reader is drawn into the situations Dubus creates so completely that for the moment, no other world seems to exist. In the thoughtful "Deaths at Sea," a naval officer writes a series of letters home to his wife about his black bunkmate, Willie, and about the burden of responsibility he, as a white Southerner, has always felt for the oppression of blacks. "Rose," every bit as compelling, is the story a woman tells to her bar partner about her silent complicity in her husband's abuse of their children. In all of the narratives, the human, and humanitarian, spirit triumphs over what can only be called the forces of darkness. Moral struggle comes as naturally to these people as good writing does to Dubus (whose last book was Voices from the Moon. His words and characterizations are infallibly right, yet he never abandons good storytelling in his desire to make a point. The majesty of these pieces remains long after the reader closes the book. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Rose,&#39; by itself, is worth the price of the book; it is the most powerful entry in Dubus&#39;s impressive canon. --Time</p><h2>Men: Evolutionary and Life History</h2><p><p> Males account for roughly 50 percent of the global population, but in America and other places, they account for over 85 percent of violent crime. A graph of relative risk of death in human males shows that mortality is high immediately following birth, falls during childhood, then exhibits a distinct rise between the ages of 15 and 35&#x2014;primarily the result of accidents, violence, and risky behaviors. Why? What compels males to drive fast, act violently, and behave stupidly? Why are men's lives so different from those of women? </p><p> <i>Men</i> presents a new approach to understanding the human male by drawing upon life history and evolutionary theory. Because life history theory focuses on the timing of, and energetic investment in, particular aspects of physiology, such as growth and reproduction, Richard Bribiescas and his fellow anthropologists are now using it in the study of humans. This has led to an increased understanding of human female physiology&#x2014;especially growth and reproduction&#x2014;from an evolutionary and life history perspective. However, little attention has been directed toward these characteristics in males. <i>Men</i> provides a new understanding of human male physiology and applies it to contemporary health issues such as prostate cancer, testosterone replacement therapy, and the development of a male contraceptive. </p><p> <i>Men</i> proves that understanding human physiology requires global research in traditionally overlooked areas and that evolutionary and life history theory have much to offer toward this endeavor. </p></p><p>Richard G. Bribiescas is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Yale University.Bribiescas successfully merges ideas and data from the fields of anthropology, archaeology, physiology, and evolutionary biology, and applies them to a subject that is rarely addressed explicitly: life history evolution (i.e., patterns of development, reproduction, and resource allocation) in human males...Bribiescas provides an insightful overview of this overlooked aspect of human biology.<br> --Brent Graves (<i>American Journal of Human Biology</i> 2007-05-01)<br><br>A text that demands to be closely read, with great fascination.<br> --Ray Olson (<i>Booklist</i> 2006-11-01)<br><br>In this unique book, anthropologist Bribiescas looks at how and why men are different from women. No one disputes there are differences between the sexes, but seldom are the causes of those differences considered. Bribiescas compares human males to males of other species, looking for differences and similarities. Biological factors such as reproductive tendencies, hormones, fat, muscle, and aging are explored in conjunction with cultural and historical facts at play. The application of male physiology is probed as it relates to current male health issues like prostate cancer, development of a male contraceptive, and testosterone replacement therapy. The resulting book does not purport that biology can predict or explain everything about male behavior. What it does provide, however, are several interesting and provocative suggestions as to why men tend to engage in warfare and genocide and exert control over economics and politics throughout the world.<br> --Gloria Maxwell (<i>Library Journal</i> 2006-11-15)<br><br>Richard Bribiescas puts men under the microscope and discovers reasons for their dysfunctionality...as well as their success at accumulating social, economic, and political power. In <i>Men</i>, Bribiescas unravels maleness using traditional evolutionary theory alongside something called 'life history theory': an approach common in contemporary biology that seeks to understand the impact on human behavior of important life events such as growth and reproduction.<br> --Ludovic Hunter-Tilney (<i>Financial Times</i> 2006-11-24)<br><br>This book aims to redress an imbalance: while in the age of feminism much insightful work has been done on women's life history, we poor chaps have been rather overlooked. Essentially, the book asks: 'What makes a man a man?' And at its heart is an attempt to find out why males, who make up 50 per cent of the population, account for 85 per cent of violent crime. In this hunt, a substantial place is set aside for that lethal substance, testosterone. Yet Bribiescas also examines the huge problem faced by men but not women--that of parental certainty...Bribiescas writes in an intelligent and thoughtful manner. Although he is an eminent scholar in his discipline, biological anthropology, his book is easily digestible by any beginner. Yet it sets out to defend an original line of thought that will be keenly debated by anyone with an interest in the field.<br> --James Plumb (<i>New Statesman</i>)<br><br>The author is well positioned to write this book...His familiarity with the variable ways in which males lead their lives facilitates insightful views of comparative human population biology...Good signs that you enjoy a book include staying awake to finish reading it when you should be sleeping, and smiling while reading alone. In the case of <i>Men</i>, I stayed awake until 3:00 A.M. finishing it, while laughing out loud...Bribiescas' fun, lively, and accessible prose makes for a successful trek into the male wilderness. Words like gonadotropin and catabolize may be new ideas (for some readers) falling from the trees, but you'll see the forest here in refreshing ways.<br> --Peter B. Gray (<i>Journal of Mammalian Evolution</i> 2007-02-15)<br><br>For anyone interested in the evolutionary and life history of human males, this may be just the book to have on one's shelf. Yale anthropologist Bribiescas's task is simple yet elegant: examine human males and determine how they differ behaviorally from both women and nonhuman males. Everyone knows there are physiological differences between men and women, but to what degree are the differences biologically related? Any modern answer to this seemingly perplexing (some would argue unanswerable) question is grounded in both evolutionary and life-history theory. Most readers will be familiar with the first, at least to some degree, but the second is newer and not as well known. Whereas evolutionary theory explains the origin and development of species through time, life-history theory explains the evolution of significant life events such as reproduction. It bypasses the simple, erroneous theorem that organisms attempt to maximize their longevity, substituting instead an emphasis on optimal lifetime reproductive success...Of great interest to lay readers with an interest in the age-old question of why men act the way they do.<br> --M.

The plan was to introduce his listeners to English writers from Bede to Aldous Huxley, pausing along the way not only at the great classic but also among the lesser known Restoration poets and Victorian novelists. To this, as also in his shrewd and dynamic appraisal of the French novelist Stendhal, he brought the lucid intellect and warmth of feeling that informs his own deeply Sicilian creative genius.A gathering of fiction and nonfiction pieces by di Lampedusa (18961957), best known as the author of The Leopard, a magnificently dramatic tale closely drawn from the author's own aristocratic world in Sicily at the turn of the century. This volume is exciting for the insight it provides into the evolution of that masterpiece through the original text of a previously abridged memoir, ``Places of My Infancy.'' The collection also includes ``The Professor and the Siren,'' an enchantingly sensual, fablelike story, and two other short stories, ``Joy and the Law'' and ``The Blind Kittens'' (the latter is the remaining fragment of an unfinished novel). The memoir evokes the author's Sicilian childhood and home, which he loved with ``utter abandon'' until that life vanished with the Risorgimento. Di Lampedusa reminisces about the the palace-size 18th-century house (``a self-sufficient entity . . . a kind of Vatican as it were'') and about the garden, ``brim full of surprises.'' By contrast, ``Joy and the Law'' is a tale that chronicles morality and honor, set against the corruption that then dominated Sicily. The story also hints, in its style, at di Lampedusa's admiration for Dickensian narrative. The collection's centerpiece, however, is a sampling of his short essays (appearing in English for the first time) about his favorite literary icons, including Austen, Stendhal, and Shakespeare, written as notes to lectures he intended for a small group of students. These essays are intuitive and highly anecdotal, yet thoroughly informed. Literature was di Lampedusa's consolation, as his wife observed, for any moment ``when he saw something disagreeable.'' He might, indeed, as translator Gilmour comments, have ``sacrificed ten years of his life . . . for the privilege of meeting Sir John Falstaff.'' This gem of a volume offers delightful glimpses of a writer worthy of attention well beyond the university circles that have until now adulated him. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now, available for the first time in trade paperback, Hawking presents an even more comprehensive look at our universe, its creation, and how we see ourselves within it. Imagine sitting in a comfortable room listening to Hawking discuss his latest theories and place them in historical context with science&#39;s other great achievements--it would be like hearing Christopher Columbus deliver the news about the new world. Hawking presents a series of seven lectures in which he describes, more clearly than ever, the history of the universe as we know it. He begins with the history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle&#39;s idea that the Earth is round to Hubble&#39;s discovery two millennium later that our universe is growing. Using this history as a launching pad, Hawking takes us on a fascinating journey through the telescopic lens of modern physics to gain a new glimpse of the universe--the nature of black holes, the space-time continuum, and new information about the origin of the universe. He uses this scientific basis to come up with a &#34;unified theory of everything&#34; that the author claims will be &#34;the ultimate triumph of human reason.&#34;</p><p>With a title inspired as much by Douglas Adams' <i>Hitchhiker</i> series as Einstein, <i>The Theory of Everything</i> delivers almost as much as it promises. Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures, the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces, but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math, Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water, for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes), he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by, the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material, from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end, is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all, Hawking is famous for his "we would know the mind of God" remark, which ends the final lecture herein. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Audio version delivered by Stephen W.

He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle.</p><p>We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)&#x2014;on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness&#x2014; and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, <i>Apocolocyntosis</i> (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes.

Starting in the late 1800s, wealthy sportsmen constructed clubs that sparked an era often referred to as the &#34;resort heyday.&#34; An explosion of resorts and cottages beckoned tourists to come to hunt, fish, enjoy nature&#39;s gifts, or be entertained. In 1910, the Chicago Tribune referred to the area as the &#34;Vice Capital,&#34; noting the openness of gambling, saloons, dance halls, and more. Through the magic of vintage postcards, some of the ghosts of the past are brought to life in this book--scenery, structures, boats, and people gone but not totally forgotten.</p><p>Longtime resident and community activist Paul J. Jakstas<br>teamed with four other like-minded Fox Lake residents who share a passion for the area's history. Together they<br>have sourced a unique collection of postcards, providing<br>visual reminders of the lives, culture, and structures of the region, focused on the fi rst half of the 20th century.

In time, the group became a kind of accidental utopia, a community bound by celebration and deliberately void of structure and authority. In this joyful and engaging book, John Bealle tells the lively history of the Bloomington Old-Time Music and Dance Group&#x2015;how it was formed, how it evolved its unique culture, and how it grew to shape and influence new waves of traditional music and dance. Broader questions about the folk revival movement, social resistance, counter culture, authenticity, and identity intersect this delightful history. More than a story about the people who forged the group or an extraordinary convergence of talent and creativity, Old-Time Music and Dance follows the threads of American folk culture and the social experience generated by this living tradition of music and dance.</p></p><p>A window into the hey-day of old-time music and dance in the Midwest.<p>John Bealle is an independent scholar who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio. He is author of Public Worship, Private Faith: Sacred Harp and American Folksong and an accomplished old-time fiddler.

William</p><p></p><h2>Word meanings in the New Testament</h2><p>Dr. Earle had two goals in mind as he wrote and compiled these fascinating word studies:To help the preacher understand the Scriptures more clearly and to expound their message more accurately and effectivelyTo help all students of the Word to discover the rich mine of truth awaiting those who study the original language of the biblical text.As an aid to the layperson, all Greek words have been transliterated, and the accompanying discussion is always practical rather than technical. All words and phrases are treated in canonical order book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse. Cross references are numerous. Each study is introduced with a verse number and the word or words (from the King James Version) in bold print. Layout and design provide for quick reference. Although translations help to convey the meanings of many words and phrases in the original Greek of the New Testament, no translation can possibly bring out all the varied nuances of the Greek. That is why Word Meanings can be an important tool for the person who desires to understand the Word of God more fully.Dr. Earle draws from many translators and commentators, always seeking to determine the meaning and intent of the original words. Frequently he presents more than one meaning, but he is not hesitant to express his preference. These word studies were published earlier in six smaller volumes (1974-1984).</p><p>Ralph Earle has served as Distinguished Professor of New Testament Emeritus at the Nazarene Theological Seminary, Kansas City, Missouri, where he first began teaching in 1945.<p>In more recent years he has served on the fifteen-man Committee on Bible Translation, the governing body for the New International Version of the Bible.</p></p><h2>Dangerous Pleasure (Bound Hearts)</h2><p><p><b><i>Get lost in Dangerous Pleasure, the explosive Bound Hearts novel by #1 New York Times bestselling author Lora Leigh. </i></b></p><br><p><b><i>He was determined to satisfy her every need. . .</i></b></p><br><p>Abram Mustafa faces the test of his life and his heart when his terrorist father kidnaps Paige Galbraithe, the one woman who has always been able to touch Abram&#x2019;s soul.

The Washington Post Book World<br>At long last, Gay Talese, one of America's greatest living authors, employs his prodigious storytelling gifts to tell the saga of his own family's emigration to America from Italy in the years preceding World War II. Ultimately it is the story of all immigrant families and the hope and sacrifice that took them from the familiarity of the old world into the mysteries and challenges of the new.</p><p>Gay Talese joined the reportorial staff of The New York Times in 1955, and remained there for a decade. During the 1960s and 1970s he contributed many articles to magazines, principally Esquire. He is the author of seven previous books, includingthree bestsellers: Thy Neighbor&#39;s Wife, Honor Thy Father, and The Kingdom and the Power. He was born in Ocean City, New Jersey, in with his wife, Nan A. Talese, an editor and publisher, and their daughters Pamela and Catherine.1.<br><br> The beach in winter was dank and desolate, and the island dampened by the frigid spray of the ocean waves pounding relentlessly against the beachfront bulkheads, and the seaweed-covered beams beneath the white houses on the dunes creaked as quietly as the crabs crawling nearby.<br><br> The boardwalk that in summer was a festive promenade of suntanned couples and children&#x2019;s balloons, of carousel tunes and colored lights spinning at night from the Ferris wheel, was occupied in winter by hundreds of sea gulls perched on the iron railings facing into the wind. When not resting they strutted outside the locked doors of vacated shops, or circled high in the sky, holding clams in their beaks that they soon dropped upon the boardwalk with a splattering cluck. Then they zoomed down and pounced on the exposed meat, pecking and pulling until there was nothing left but the jagged, salty white chips of empty shells.<br><br> By midwinter the shell-strewn promenade was a vast cemetery of clams, and from a distance the long elevated flat deck of the boardwalk resembled a stranded aircraft carrier being attacked by dive-bombers&#x2014;and oddly juxtaposed in the fog behind the dunes loomed the rusting remains of a once sleek four-masted vessel that during a gale in the winter of 1901 had run aground on this small island in southern New Jersey called Ocean City.<br><br> The steel-hulled ship, flying a British flag and flaunting hundred-fifty-foot masts, had been sailing north along the New Jersey coast toward New York City, where it was scheduled to deliver one million dollars&#x2019; worth of Christmas cargo it had picked up five months before in Kobe, Japan. But during the middle of the night, while a number of crewmen drank rum and beer in a premature toast to the long journey&#x2019;s end, a fierce storm rose and destroyed the ship&#x2019;s sails, snapped its masts, and drove it into a sandbar within one hundred yards of the Ocean City boardwalk.<br><br> Awakened by the distress signals that flared in the night, the alarmed residents of Ocean City&#x2014;a conservative community founded in 1879 by Methodist ministers and other Prohibitionists who wished to establish an island of abstinence and propriety&#x2014;hastened to help the sailors, who were soon discovered to be battered but unharmed and smelling of sweat, salt water, and liquor.<br><br> After the entire thirty-three-man crew had been escorted to shore, they were sheltered and fed for days under the auspices of the town&#x2019;s teetotaling elders and ministers&#x2019; wives; and while the sailors expressed gratitude for such hospitality they privately cursed their fate in being shipwrecked on an island so sedate and sober. But soon they were relocated by British nautical authorities, and the salvageable cargo was barged to New York to be sold at reduced prices. And the town returned to the tedium of winter.<br><br> The big ship, however, remained forever lodged in the soft white sand&#x2014;unmovable, slowly sinking, a sight that served Ocean City&#x2019;s pious guardians as a daily reminder of the grim consequences of intemperate guidance. But as I grew up in the late 1930s, more than three decades after the shipwreck&#x2014;when the visible remnants at low tide consisted only of the barnacle-bitten ridge of the upper deck, the corroded brown rudder post and tiller, and a single lopsided mast&#x2014;I viewed the vessel as a symbol of adventure and risk; and during my boyhood wanderings along the beach I became enchanted with exotic fantasies of nights in foreign ports, of braving the waves and wind with wayward men, and of escaping the rigid confines of this island on which I was born but never believed I belonged.<br><br> I saw myself always as an alien, an outsider, a drifter who, like the shipwrecked sailors, had arrived by accident. I felt different from my young friends in almost every way, different in the cut of my clothes, the food in my lunch box, the music I heard at home on the record player, the ideas and inner thoughts I revealed on those rare occasions when I was open and honest.<br><br> I was olive-skinned in a freckle-faced town, and I felt unrelated even to my parents, especially my father, who was indeed a foreigner&#x2014;an unusual man in dress and manner, to whom I bore no physical resemblance and with whom I could never identify. Trim and elegant, with wavy dark hair and a small rust-colored moustache, he spoke English with an accent and received letters bearing strange-looking stamps.<br><br> These letters sometimes contained snapshots of soldiers wearing uniforms with insignia and epaulets unlike any I had seen on the recruit- ment posters displayed throughout the island. They were my uncles and cousins, my father explained to me quietly one day early in World War II, when I was ten; they were fighting in the Italian army, and&#x2014;it was unnecessary for him to add&#x2014;their enemy included the government of the United States.<br><br> I became increasingly sensitive to this fact when I sat through the newsreels each week at the local cinema; next to my unknowing classmates, I watched with private horror the destruction by Allied bombers of mountain villages and towns in southern Italy to which I was ancestrally linked through a historically ill-timed relationship with my Italian father. At any moment I half expected to see up on the screen, gazing down at me from a dust-covered United States Army truck filled with disheveled Italian prisoners being guarded at gunpoint, a sad face that I could identify from one of my father&#x2019;s snapshots.<br><br> My father, on the other hand, seemed to share none of my confused sense of patriotism during the war years. He joined a citizens&#x2019; committee of shore patrolmen who kept watch along the waterfront at night, standing with binoculars on the boardwalk under the stanchioned lights that on the ocean side were painted black as a precaution against discovery by enemy submarines.<br><br> He made headlines in the local newspaper after a popular speech to the Rotary Club in which he reaffirmed his loyalty to the Allied cause, declaring that were he not too old for the draft (he was thirty-nine) he would proudly join the American troops at the front, in a uniform devotedly cut and stitched with his own hands.<br><br> Trained as an apprentice tailor in his native village, and later an assistant cutter in a prominent shop in Paris that employed an older Italian cousin, my father arrived in Ocean City circuitously and impulsively at the age of eighteen in 1922 with very little money, an extensive wardrobe, and the outward appearance of a man who knew exactly where he was going, when in fact nothing was further from the truth. He knew no one in town, barely knew the language, and yet, with a self-assurance that has always mystified me, he adjusted to this unusual island as readily as he could cut cloth to fit any size and shape.<br><br> Having noticed a &#x201c;For Sale&#x201d; sign in the window of a tailor shop in the center of town, my father approached the asthmatic owner, who was desperate to leave the island for the drier climate of Arizona. After a brief negotiation, my father acquired the business and thus began a lengthy, spirited campaign to bring the rakish fashion of the Continental boulevardier to the comparatively continent men of the south Jersey shore.<br><br> But after decorating his windows with lantern-jawed mannequins holding cigarettes and wearing Borsalino hats, and draping his counters with bolts of fine imported fabrics&#x2014;and displaying on his walls such presumably persuasive regalia as his French master tailor&#x2019;s diploma bordered by cherubim and a Greek goddess&#x2014;my father made so few sales during his first year that he was finally forced to introduce into his shop a somewhat undignified gimmick called the Suit Club.<br><br> At the cost of one dollar per week, Suit Club members would print their names and addresses on small white cards and, after placing the cards in unmarked envelopes, would deposit them into a large opaque vase placed prominently atop a velvet-covered table next to a fashion photograph of a dapper man and woman posing with a greyhound on the greensward of an ornate country manor.<br><br> Each Friday evening just prior to closing time, my father would invite one of the assembled Suit Club members to close his eyes and pick from the vase a single envelope, which would reveal the name of the fortunate winner of a free suit, to be made from fabric selected by that individual; after two fittings, it would be ready for wearing within a week.<br><br> Since as many as three or four hundred people were soon paying a dollar each week to partake in this raffle, my father was earning on each free suit a profit perhaps three times the average cost of a custom-made suit in those days&#x2014;to say nothing of the additional money he earned when he enticed a male winner into purchasing an extra pair of matching trousers.<br><br> But my father&#x2019;s bonanza was abruptly terminated one day in 1928, when an anonymous complaint sent to City Hall, possibly by a rival tailor, charged that the Suit Club was a form of gambling clearly outlawed under the town charter; thus ended for all time my father&#x2019;s full-time commitment to the reputable but precarious life of an artist with a needle and thread. My father did not climb down from an impoverished mountain in southern Italy and forsake the glorious lights of Paris and sail thousands of miles to the more opportunistic shores of America to end up as a poor tailor in Ocean City, New Jersey.<br><br> So he diversified. Advertising himself as a ladies&#x2019; furrier who could alter or remodel old coats as well as provide resplendent new ones (which he obtained on consignment from a Russian Jewish immigrant who resided in nearby Atlantic City), my father expanded his store to accommodate a refrigerated fur storage vault and extended the rear of the building to include a...</p><h2>Luba: The Angel of Bergen-Belsen</h2><p>Why am I still alive?

Blavatsky. Blavatsky is best known today for co-founding the Theosophical School, a religious school of thought that she labeled "the archaic Wisdom-Religion, the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization&#x201d;, and nobody was more qualified than Blavatsky to forge such a creation. During her second marriage, Blavatsky traveled to various parts of the world, including Egypt, France, Germany, Mexico, South America, Canada, and India, absorbing all the diverse cultures, customs, religions, and philosophies she came across. <br> Once she had extensively studied all of the different movements she had experienced, Blavatsky went about synthesizing Theosophy and creating a worldview that offered explanations for the origin, workings and ultimate fate of every aspect of mankind&#x2019;s existence, in order to &#x201c;form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.&#x201d; Blavatsky did so by becoming an incredibly prolific writer, and some of her works have become cult classics, particularly The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled. These works included her unique blend of science, esoteric ideas, the occult, and ancient religions and philosophies, and they remain popular today. <br> The Mother of Theosophy: The Life and Legacy of H.P. Blavatsky profiles the life, works, and legacy of the influential scholar, writer, philosopher and theologian, examining her movement and its origins.

Ingenious.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Laura Miller, Salon on The Southern Reach Trilogy</i></p><p>&#x201c;A clear triumph for Vandermeer . . . a compelling, elegant, and existential story . . . .The solitary voice of its post-humanist narrator is both deeply flawed and deeply trustworthy--a difficult and excellent balance in a novel whose world is built seamlessly and whose symbols are rich and dark.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lydia Millet, LA Times on The Southern Reach Trilogy</i></p><p>&#x201c;A book about an intelligent, deadly fungus makes for an enthralling read--trust us.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tara Wanda Merrigan, GQ on The Southern Reach Trilogy</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] strange, clever, off-putting, maddening, claustrophobic, occasionally beautiful, occasionally disturbing and altogether fantastic book . . . <i>Annihilation </i>is a book meant for gulping--for going in head-first and not coming up for air until you hit the back cover.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jason Sheehan, NPR Books on The Southern Reach Trilogy</i></p><p>&#x201c;Successfully creepy, an old-style gothic horror novel set in a not-too-distant future.

In 1935, several such programs were consolidated into the Resettlement Administration, which in 1937 became the Farm Security Administration (FSA). For the next six years, the FSA stayed at the center of a turbulent battle over the shift from regional to national authority. One tool the FSA used to defend itself against political attacks was its Photographic Section, under the direction of Roy Stryker. Stryker, who was once referred to as &#x201c;the press agent of the underprivileged,&#x201d; directed a team of photographers who documented American life in the thirties, capturing images of the old ways while seeking to justify a new agricultural order. The photos they took were used to build up popular support for the FSA and the New Deal. Seven of these photographers traveled in Missouri and produced a collection of over 1,250 pictures. Drawing on those photographs, <i>A Portrait of Missouri, 1935-1943</i> chronicles the photographers&#x2019; work, the programs they sought to promote, and slices of life they captured in Missouri during this time.&nbsp; Small town life, desperate farm conditions, urban renewal, and the 1939 sharecroppers&#x2019; strike are all brought to life in these intriguing photos. However, <i>A Portrait of Missouri, 1935&#x2013;1943</i> is more than a picture book. Through its introductory essay and the text that accompanies the photos, the book traces the changing nature of agriculture in the early part of the twentieth century and recounts the effects of the depression on Missouri. The photographs from the FSA file help the reader to examine how social and economic changes were tied to demands for political changes, and to consider the intended and actual effects on Missourians of the national government&#x2019;s policies. Political realities, including limited resources that allowed the FSA to serve only a fraction of the population that sought aid, and organized opposition, based in part on class and race, limited the achievements of the FSA. Sixty years after its demise, the FSA is still seen as a savior by some and a bedeviler by others. <i>A Portrait of Missouri, 1935-1943 </i>helps the reader better understand the debate over the FSA, while providing a unique glimpse of midwestern American life in the 1930s.</p><p><p>Paul E. Parker is Professor of Political Science at Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri. </p><p>"The photographs are engrossing. They show the efforts of the Farm Security Administration to illustrate the problems of the 1930s and the results of the programs designed by the New Deal to address these problems. More than simply being a vehicle of persuasion, however, these photographs document the way Missourians lived during the period."<br> &#x2014;Lawrence Christensen</p></p><h2>Kane of Old Mars (Eternal Champion)</h2><p>The ninth volume of the Eternal Champion series collects one of Michael Moorcock's most epic fantasy adventures--the story of Kane of Old Mars.

Henry Bergson (1859-1941) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1927. His works include Time and Free Will, An Introduction to Metaphysics, Creative Evolution, and The Creative Mind.</p><p>In one of his most important philosophical writings, Henri Bergson here discusses how the matter of the brain and the world external to the body create mental impressions and memories. Matter and Memory, first published in 1912, introduced the current selectionist theories of memory, which postulate that there is a part of the brain that generates all possible images to be stored in memory and a part of the brain that chooses which images to store. <p>Crossing academic disciplines and touching on matters that concern us all--how do we remember, and why?--this essential work will enthrall students of philosophy and psychology and lay readers alike.</p>Henri Bergson (1859-1941) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1927.

They called themselves Twi, Yoruba, Zulu, Ashanti, and Kumba, among other names. In the early sixteenth century Europeans turned to Africa for the labor force needed to mine, cultivate, and process the bounty of natural resources in the newly colonized Americas. As many as 12 million Africans from varied ethnic backgrounds endured forced migration and enslavement. Out of their suffering was forged a new people--no longer simply Twi, Yoruba, Ashanti, or Kumba. In the Americas, they first became Africans and then African Americans.<br> <em>The First Passage</em> examines the first century of the recorded black presence in the Americas. The ordeal of the Atlantic crossing gave way to the isolation and humiliation of slavery and the loss of friends and family. Some slaves attempted rebellion and escape. Others maintained as many religious and cultural traditions as possible and as the African-American population grew, forged new traditions and new ties of kinship. This history remains at the core of black life in the Americas. Colin Palmer tells a story of extraordinary suffering. But <em>The First Passage</em> is also a timeless lesson in endurance and survival.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Colin A. Palmer</strong> is Distinguished Professor of History at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br><br>"Undoubtedly one of the most complete overall studies of slavery.... Ranges from detailing differences among African cultures to providing precise information on the changes traditional customs and religions underwent as a result of diaspora and enslavement."--<em>School Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Emphasizing the diversity of the African continent, historian Palmer looks in some detail at the development of the slave trade, the forced migration and enslavement of what is estimated to be between 10 million and 20 million people, and the roles that blacks plays in the New World in the sixteenth century.... While never playing down the atrocity and suffering, he describes how an enduring African American culture developed in the diaspora."--<em>Booklist</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"An important examination of the earliest recorded Black presence in the Americas."--<em>National Black Employment Directory</em><p></p><br>"Although <em>First Passage</em> is the first volume in the <em>Young Oxford History of African Americans,</em> these works should be required reading for people of all ages and all races."--<em>Copley News Service</em><p></p><br>"Probes the ordeal of the first blacks to cross over to the Americas."--<em>Children's Bookwatch</em><p></p><br>"<em>The First Passage</em> is well-researched, well-written, and beautifully illustrated. It is an excellent introduction to the history of African Americans."--Henry Louis Gates, Jr.<p></p><br></p><h2>Love Stories: Sex between Men before Homosexuality</h2><p>In <i>Love Stories</i>, Jonathan Ned Katz presents stories of men's intimacies with men during the nineteenth century&#x2014;including those of Abraham Lincoln&#x2014;drawing flesh-and-blood portraits of intimate friendships and the ways in which men struggled to name, define, and defend their sexual feelings for one another. In a world before "gay" and "straight" referred to sexuality, men like Walt Whitman and John Addington Symonds created new ways to name and conceive of their erotic relationships with other men. Katz, diving into history through diaries, letters, newspapers, and poems, offers us a clearer picture than ever before of how men navigated the uncharted territory of male-male desire.<br></p><p>Abraham Lincoln arrived in Springfield, Illinois, on April 15, 1837, and met Joshua Fry Speed, who offered the new legislator half of his double bed.

The story of Lincoln's relationship with Speed, which opens this book, transports us into a forgotten world of love between men.<br><br>Jonathan Ned Katz presents stories of men's intimacies with men in the nineteenth century, tales with all the features of a good novel: engaging characters, moving conflicts, and surprising revelations. Katz draws flesh-and-blood portraits of these intimate friendships, tracing the way men struggled to name, define, and defend their deep feelings for one another. Some of these are love stories, some sex stories, some stories about love and sex. In a world before "gay" and "straight" referred to sexuality, men like Lincoln, Walt Whitman, John Addington Symonds, and James Mills Peirce created new, affirmative ways of naming and conceiving their intimacies with other men.

Since when is originality considered an indispensable attribute of authorship? Stolen Words is a deft and well-informed history of the sin every writer fears from every angle. Award-winning author Thomas Mallon begins in the seventeenth century and pushes forward toward scandals in publishing, academia, and Hollywood, exploring the motivations, consequences, and emotional reverberations of an intriguing and distressingly widespread practice. In this now-classic study, Mallon proves himself to be one of our most versatile, original, and delightful writers.<br></p><p>Thomas Mallon is the author of five novels and five works of nonfiction. He is a frequent contributor to the New York Times Magazine and GQ. He received the National Book Critics Circle award for reviewing in 1998. The recipient of a 2000 Guggenheim Fellowship, he lives in Westport, Connecticut.<br>Mallon, who examined diaries in A Book of One's Own , here probes the opposite end of the literary spectrum: plagiarism. Although ably researched and enthusiastic and clever in tone, the book has an uneasy mix of topics which may preclude its finding an audience. With a close comparison of texts, Mallon discusses suspicious similarities between the works of Victorian novelist and international copyright champion Charles Reade and Frenchwoman Charles Reybaud, the writings of Jayme Sokolow and fellow academic Stephen Nissenbaum in the 1970s and '80s, and Anita Clay Kornfeld's 1980 generational novel Vintage and TV's Falcon Crest. Even though they've read about the case in the New York Times et al., publishing folk will undoubtedly be most attuned to the accusations against Jacob Epstein, who apologized in print for phrases apparently lifted from Martin Amis's The Rachel Papers and integrated into Epstein's 1979 Wild Oats. Mallon concludes that literary predators often are repeat offenders and society usually is timid about prosecuting their crimes. He warns: "To see the writer's words kidnapped, to find them imprisoned, like changelings, on someone else's equally permanent page, is to become vicariously absorbed by violation." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>First Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Life, Internet Linked, Usborne, Scholastic</h2><p>What was the biggest dinosaur?

THE BRONX<br><br>Growing Up Allergic to Everything but Stickball<br><br>Marjorie Ward Marshall, my mother, was the first director I ever met.<br><br>Wearing an apron and teaching tap in the basement of our Grand Concourse apartment building, she was a Bronx housewife and a tap dance teacher you didn&#x2019;t want to mess with. She ran a tight ship, and little girls never dawdled in putting on their tap shoes and costumes in front of Mom. She believed that dancing and performing were good for children because they gave them self-esteem and a purpose all their own.<br><br>My mother taught us that the best thing in life was to entertain people and make them laugh. The biggest sin in life was to bore people.<br><br>&#x201c;Beware of the boring,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;What is boring, Ma?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Mom was a born entertainer who thought performing was not just a hobby or even a profession but a way of living that was as essential as breathing or eating. She was a five-foot-six-inch slacks-wearing perky blonde with a dancer&#x2019;s body and a comedian&#x2019;s mouth. Mom was always &#x201c;on&#x201d; from her hyper-cajoling of her dance students to her late-night intensity when she would type out the songs, dance routines, and skits for her dance recital. I would be in my bed and still hear her typewriter as I went to sleep. Her typing sounded like rain. Always working, she would go to Broadway shows, steal the routines, and come back and type them up for her students to perform. I knew right from the beginning that if I could make my mom laugh, then I could make her love me.<br><br>If Mom had been born at another time in history, she could have become a stage performer or actress herself. Born in 1910, Mom just missed the feminism movement and was faced with raising three children in the Bronx during the 1940s. Her goal in life was to teach as many kids as possible&#x2014;including her own children, Garry, Ronny, and Penny&#x2014;to tap dance. There was Ronny, the middle child, and nice daughter Penny, the youngest child, whom my mother seemed to crown &#x201c;troublemaker&#x201d; the moment she came out of the birth canal. And I, of course, was the oldest child and the one who was always sick.<br><br>Mom&#x2019;s students adored her because she was funny and irreverent whether she was charming your pants off or hurting your feelings. She commanded a kind of power and respect as a director that even Orson Welles and Martin Scorsese would find enviable. She could be encouraging to the students with talent, but spoke with a bite to those who didn&#x2019;t show potential.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2014;the pretty girl with the fat legs. You should play an instrument instead of dancing.&#x201d;<br><br>Or she might move someone behind the scenes altogether.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Zelda, or whatever your name is. You have two left feet. You can pull the curtain for the show.&#x201d;<br><br>Traditional motherhood duties took a backseat to the curtain, the audience, and showtime. Since we were always running low on milk, Mom invented the family drink &#x201c;Pepsi and milk&#x201d; to make our dairy supply last longer. When she didn&#x2019;t have time to simmer and cook fresh tomato sauce, she told us that Campbell&#x2019;s tomato soup with noodles was just as Italian as spaghetti. If we were rushing to get down to the basement to make our curtain calls, she might squirt ketchup on our pasta and call it a night. My mom could make us smile, laugh, and cry all in the same hour. On my birthday one time she said, &#x201c;Garry is celebrating eleven years of being round-shouldered.&#x201d; When my sister Penny had an overbite, she said, &#x201c;When I want to open a Pepsi bottle, I do it with Penny&#x2019;s teeth.&#x201d; She taught us that to dwell on our problems was a waste of time and to make entertainment for others was supreme.<br><br>This did little to impress my dad. My father, Anthony W. Marshall, a good-looking suit- and tie-wearing art director and advertising executive who invented his middle name, Wallace, because he thought it made him sound more distinguished. Born Anthony Masciarelli, he looked like a character from the television show Mad Men. He liked to wear suits, carry a monogrammed briefcase, and drink martinis in hotel bars. We rarely saw him drink at home, but sometimes he would stagger in and look like he&#x2019;d had a few too many someplace else. My father was not the kind of dad who would throw a ball in the street with you like the Jewish dads, Catholic dads, or even other Italian dads in our melting pot neighborhood. Throwing a ball might mess up my father&#x2019;s tie. He didn&#x2019;t talk very much but instead wrote us notes like &#x201c;Sorry you had to get a tooth pulled. It&#x2019;s over now.&#x201d; When he did talk he told stories of business trips where he met men who were working on a new device called television. He traveled for business to Florida and California and brought home oranges for us. For a long time my sisters and I imagined that both states were filled with fruit instead of people. He instilled in us the idea that there was a world outside the Bronx and that we should set sail for it as soon as we were old enough.<br><br>I was born November 13, 1934, Garry Kent Marshall, and we lived for most of my childhood along the Grand Concourse. First opened to traffic in 1909, the Grand Concourse was modeled after the Champs-Elys�es in Paris. It was four miles long and populated by Jewish and Italian families when I lived there. My apartment was in a five-story building, with empty lots on either side. We were on the first floor. It was called Argonne Manor and housed mostly Jewish families and my family. We were Italian and Christian. Most of the other Italian families lived on Villa Avenue across the street. Because I was Italian, I fit in both neighborhoods easily.<br><br>My address was 3235 Grand Concourse. My favorite number has always been thirteen, and the numerals of my Bronx address added up to it, too. Like my father, I was given an arbitrary middle name, Kent, to give me dignity. My first name, with the rare two-r spelling, came from a sportswriter named Garry Schumacher. My parents didn&#x2019;t know him personally, but my mother liked the spelling.<br><br>My happiest moments of growing up in the Bronx were when my mom would bring home a new sports magazine from the candy store. I would jump out of bed and grab it from her. Then I&#x2019;d rip the front cover right off and tape it to my bedroom wall. I would reposition myself comfortably in bed and look up at all of the athletes who floated above me like heroes and angels.<br><br>Often I would turn on the radio, lie in my bed, and listen to the Yankees baseball game. I&#x2019;d dream about my hands-down favorite player, Joe DiMaggio, and the day when I might be able to have a job that I could do well, too. There were many baseball players who were just as famous but who didn&#x2019;t impress us, like Billy Martin and Ted Williams. To be able to make a living playing a sport you loved was what made Joe our favorite. I didn&#x2019;t know what job I might be destined for, but my dad told me it better be something I could do with a headache or a toothache, because the whole family agreed I was not destined for good health. As a child I was often sick, plagued by some ailment or allergy, or my ability to hang on to a perpetual sniffle or wheeze from one winter to the next. My baby book read like a list of the greatest diseases of all time. I once heard a doctor say that if we didn&#x2019;t move to Arizona, I might die. I packed my bags. The next day I woke up to see if anyone was packing their bags. No one was.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad, when do we leave for Arizona?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going anywhere. We can&#x2019;t afford it.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought they were trying to kill me.<br><br>Despite being sick all the time, I seemed to be destined for a career in show business. My mother sent my three-year-old baby picture to a contest in the Bronx Home News. I won the prize for cutest kid in my age division, and received a check for fifteen dollars. This encouraged my mom to think I could go on to become a child model. I auditioned and got cast in a milk commercial. Unfortunately, I spit up all over the director, and my modeling career was short-lived.<br><br>When I was five years old my parents gave me a drum set for Christmas. My mom played the piano, and Dad played the saxophone badly. But that Christmas morning I remember we all played together and I thought it was the greatest day ever. We were a band, and I imagined us practicing and performing as a family band for years to come. Unfortunately, Dad never played the saxophone with our band again. That Christmas morning remains imprinted in my mind as one of the few times we all got along. In general my dad thought entertainment was a waste of time and did little to support my mother&#x2019;s dance studio or our performing aspirations.<br><br>Dad&#x2019;s ambivalence, however, did not stop my mother or us. One day Dad was at work and Mom had a show to put on but she didn&#x2019;t have a babysitter. Her mother, Margie, whom we called Nanny, used to watch my sisters and me when we were small. She was an Irish-German rail-thin brunette with a mild New England accent. As we got older, Nanny became blind and refused to go to the doctor. Without her sight it became difficult for her to mind us and us to mind her. Sometimes Penny would sneeze and then trick Nanny by saying, &#x201c;It was Garry.&#x201d; The girls blamed me for many things because I was often too sick to put up a fight. With all of my sneezing and wheezing and pneumonia not once but twice, Nanny didn&#x2019;t know how to help me. I once fell down in the street and hit my head, and she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a dollar if you stop bleeding.&#x201d; Her reluctance to go to the doctor helped make me a hypochondriac. Nanny didn&#x2019;t even know what to feed me because I seemed to be allergic to everything under the sun, including the sun.<br><br>I was lying in bed one day, covered in compresses and trying to feel better, when my mom came into the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Get up. Let&#x2019;s go to the cellar. You&#x2019;re going to be in the show,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;But Mom, I&#x2019;m sick. I should stay in bed and get better,&#x201d; I said. I was six years old at the time, and I carried the perpetual smell of mustard plaster.<br><br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Nanny can&#x2019;t watch you anymore and I have a show to put on. So let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; she said, pulling the covers off my bed.<br><br>&#x201c;But Mom, I&#x2019;m too tired to stand up and dance,&#x201d; I begged.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said, getting fresh clothes from my dresser.<br><br>&#x201c;Then what am I going to do down there in the cellar?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Sit down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the dressing room?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Onstage. You&#x2019;ll play the drums,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;But Ma, I just started the drums. You know I&#x2019;m not very good yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. You&#x2019;ll follow my lead on the piano,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re smart and quick. You&#x2019;ll learn.&#x201d;<br><br>So we would sit onstage and she would play the piano with one hand and pat me on the back with the other. That&#x2019;s how I learned to keep a steady rhythm.<br><br>I became the official drummer for the Marjorie Ward Marshall School of Dance. I would perform in the basement and then travel with the troupe when they did shows in other towns and churches around New York. My mother didn&#x2019;t join a church based on religion. She joined whatever church had the biggest stage to dance on. Our religion was entertainment. Going to church to pray or even to read the Bible seemed secondary to delivering a great joke and making people in the congregation laugh out loud.<br><br>Ronny and Penny were reluctant performers, too, but none of us had a choice. Acting was the family pastime. However, I soon found that I liked playing the drums. Mom was right. They were a good instrument for me because they came with their own seat. From the security of my drum set, I would watch show after show of dancing, skits, and humor, and I noticed something quite amazing: Some of the skits my mother wrote got laughs and some did not. When they got a laugh I felt happy and proud for her, but when they didn&#x2019;t get applause I tried to figure out why. By the time I was seven years old, I was getting the hang of things. I figured out that the point was to induce them all to laugh, not just a few. If a skit didn&#x2019;t work, I would try to rewrite it for her to make it better. With tissues stuffed up my sleeves and a drumstick in each hand, I was becoming a self-taught producer right there onstage. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but I was also figuring out just how I might be able to make a living while sick, seated, and nauseous. <br><br>When I wasn&#x2019;t playing the drums I tried to get my energy up to play baseball, basketball, or stickball. Otherwise, I spent a lot of time in my bed feeling too sick and too skinny to do much of anything. I lived in 1-H, and I made friends with a boy named Gideon Troken, a dark-haired short kid with glasses, more interested in girls than playing ball, who lived in 1-O. He was the first intellectual I ever met. He read a lot of books, went to Hebrew school, and knew how to play the piano. He even taught me to play chess. He suggested I start collecting stamps because it was something I could do from my bed that would be worldly and important. He told me that for some small countries, stamps were the biggest export and advised me that I might make some money to fall back on from stamp collecting if my life didn&#x2019;t turn out. In exchange, I took him around the neighborhood and introduced him to some of the guys, who befriended him instead of beating him up because he was a friend of mine. I never got beaten up because I was a wisecracking jokester. I could make a bully laugh before he delivered a punch.</p><h2>Godplayer</h2><p>Cassandra Cassidy, a beautiful psychiatrist, attempts to stop the mysterious killings of terminally ill patients as she struggles to save her crumbling marriage to Thomas Kingsley, a charismatic cardiac surgeon</p><p>Dr. Robin Cook is the author of thirty previous books, most recently <em>Nano</em>, and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his wildly successful first novel, Coma.

His reviews and essays--which he began writing in the late 1930s and continued to write for almost thirty years--were possessed of a voice, vision, and passion as compelling and inspiring as his subject. As dance critic, first for <i>Modern Music</i> and then for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, and as a contributor to numerous magazines and journals&nbsp;(<i>Ballet</i>, <i>Dance Magazine</i>, <i>Mademoiselle</i>, and <i>Evergreen Review</i> among them), Denby permanently changed the way we think and talk about dance.This volume presents his reviews from <i>Modern Music</i> and the <i>Tribune</i> in chronological order, providing not only a picture of how Denby&#x2019;s dance theories and reviewing methods evolved, but also an informal history of the dance in New York from 1936 through 1945. Some of the reviews glimpse the vanished dancers and dances that were most particularly of their time. In others, Denby returns again and again to the four artists he considered exemplary: Alicia Markova, Alexandra Danilova, Martha Graham, and George Balanchine. It was Balanchine on whom Denby focused after he left the <i>Tribune</i>, and all of his post-<i>Tribune</i> writings on Balanchine and the New York City Ballet are presented here in one section, providing a history of the early artistic development of the company and of Balanchine himself, while also showing Denby&#x2019;s most eloquent and deeply felt writing.Finally there are his post-1945 reviews, essays, and lectures on such general dance subjects as the phenomenon of a truly good leap, classicism in ballet, and dance criticism itself. Here as elsewhere in the collection, the simple elegance of his writing, its evocative power, and its extraordinary timelessness make it an essential part of our dance literature.&nbsp;Edwin Denby (1903-1983) was the author of <i>Looking at the Dance</i> and <i>Dancers, Buildings, and People in the Streets, Collected Poetry</i>, and three librettos for American composer Aaron Copland.</p><h2>Magic Fire</h2><p>A young man who has been fascinated with fire since childhood, high-school senior--and pyromaniac--Mark Charm unleashes his obsession on the dry hills and valleys of Southern California.

This teen is able to start fires with the power of his mind. This pyro-kinetic ability leads him and his girlfriend into a crusade to free Earth from alien domination. The story is so convoluted that it is hard to follow. The premise is implausible-aliens have harvested human brains and are keeping them in vats, but the humans don't realize this has happened-but this is not what has really happened at all.

Searching for the culprit, he comes to a town under the control of two groups, the Salts and the Minors. Once there, to get closer to &#x201c;Iron Lahti,&#x201d; a man with the same ring as his lover, Kai becomes the man's bodyguard. </li> <li>The side story to the near-future boys' love series <i>Steal Moon</i> is finally published!</li></ul></p><p>Makoto Tateno is a top-selling yaoi artist, and is the mind behind YELLOW, KASHINFU, RED ANGEL and STEAL MOON.Kai has traveled to this city with no name for one reason, to find the murderer of his lover Maria and exact revenge. Maria wore a distinct ring and when the murderer fled the scene he was wearing her ring. While watching the television he saw a man wearing Maria's ring. That man was Lahti Bara, a one-man killing machine in the nameless town. Kai will get a job working under Lahti and take his chance at revenge. But Lahti isn't nicknamed "Steel Lahti" for nothing. He is the public face of the gang Sarte. He is quick thinking, light on his feet, and has a knack for fighting. Kai figures that being one of his posse will be the quickest way to get his vengeance.<br><br>After jumping Lahti on the street to show him his fighting prowess Kai is taken in by the Sarte group and he does become one of Lahti's bodyguards and even begins training with the man himself. Kai finds out that Lahti is gay and uses this opportunity to get even closer to Lahti. While in bed Kai tries to take the ring and some of the truth comes out. Even though Lahti wears a ring, it's not Maria's. Kai loses face because of this incident but continues to come to Lahti's aid. A surprise is in store for Kai. It turns out that Maria isn't dead at all. She implanted a chip in Kai's head and had used this to alter his memory during the incident. Maria is also Lahti's twin sister. It also seems that Maria is now aligned with the rival gang. It's just the beginning of this intense action packed tale penned by the one and only Makoto Tateno-sama.<br><br>I thought that the name Blue Sheep Reverie was a very weird name for a manga. It still is a weird name but at least now I know the origins of the name. It seems as though the rings that Lahti and Maria are blue and look like sheep's eyes. This is the "prequel" (in a very rough sense of the word) to another title Tateno-sama title, Steal Moon. Really all that these two stories have in common is Lahti and Kai showing up as minor characters. If you are looking for a hardcore yaoi title you won't find it in this volume of Blue Sheep Reverie. According to Tateno-sama this was originally written as a shojo title but then a boys love magazine picked it up. So yes a woman plays a larger role and there isn't much in boys getting it on. But I have high hopes for the next volume. The series currently has two volumes released in Japan and is still ongoing so who knows what is in store for us.<br><br>I can't rave enough about the art that Tateno-sama provides for us. But along with her immaculate art style she is an amazing storyteller. I was riveted from the beginning. Each character is unique in their look as well as their personalities. Maria is the ultimate villain. Tateno-sama has the ability to create strong women characters for her stories and Maria is definitely strong character, even though she's the antagonist. Lahti is a character that you can't help feel for even though he is a cold guy. Kai is endearing and he brings a lot to the story.<br>For fans of Makoto Tateno-sama this is a don't miss title. If you've checked out Steal Moon this is a title that you'll want to read as well. Even if you haven't read Steal Moon I recommend it. If you're new to her work just sit back and enjoy her gorgeous men, beautiful women, and all around stunning art. Definitely check out Blue Sheep Reverie vol. 1. --Manic About Manga<br><br>After the murder of his girlfriend, Maria, Kei finds himself drawn to a dangerous city renowned for its warring rival gangs. Determined to get close to one such gang, and inparticular one man within it, Kai makes a bold move in requesting to be bodyguard to the powerful Lahti. Once inside this circle, however, some deadly wheels start turning as assassins target Lahti and Kai finds himself defending the one person whose life he seeks to take in vengeance.<br><br>Boys love wise, Blue Sheep Reverie doesn't have a whole lot to offer fans but that doesn't mean it doesn't present much to anticipate. There's a one-time fling, a regret that it was only a one-time fling and some ambigious interaction that's likely prelude to some more intimates later. Fans of Makoto Tateno will find her artwork familiar, toting the willowy-haired pretty boys and their wistful stares into space. I enjoyed some of her action rendering but felt that some parts didn't have as much detail as they required (are they fighting with a string of pearls?).<br><br>While there might not be much man on man action, the book doesn't hold back with some other firey dramatics to keep things going. Rival gang wars and a target on Lahti's head make for lots of dangerous situations. Watching him teach Kai the specifics of fighting and how to better take a life is both interesting and methodical, with a healthy dash of inter-group politics regarding a group's mysterious Four Kings. Some of the book's most climatic moments will be undoubtedly predicted by some readers, putting a little damper on the tension, but the emotional effect on the characters is enough to make even the most cookie-cutter moments at least a little stirring.<br><br>Though this first volume of Blue Sheep Reverie may not live up to the expectations of some boys love fans looking for more action between the sheets than on the streets, its semi-futuristic plot line of gangs, murder and survival are really what make it a book worth reading. Amidst the dead-girlfriend angst and a world that could stand to be fleshed out more than its explored, its a story that's still tailored to a boys love audience, and seems keen on catering to it, but one that doesn't lean on the boys love like a crutch. Even if the main plot points are predictable (and I got a serious woman-are-the-enemy vibe), I still anticipate volume two to see where Kai s newly carved paths will take him, and he and Lahti can survive it. --Kuriousity<br><br>Kai was once in love, even in the dark city of danger where he lives. But his beautiful Maria was murdered and all he has as a clue to find her killer is the unique ring she wore, one now worn by the head of the powerful Sarte Group, the lethal Steel Lahti! Now Kai will risk body and soul to uncover if Lahti is the murderer. It will mean getting close to one of the most dangerous men alive. But what happens when it's more than just his life on the line, but Kai's heart?<br><br>Blue Sheep Reverie is a wonderfully intricate yaoi story that blends danger, sci-fi, action, crime, and romance all in one. Kai must find a way to get close to Lahti. To do so he tries out to be one of his bodyguards. But this is a trial where the loser could well lose his life! Kai is not a killer, but to get close to the man who murdered his lover, he will have to become one. Can Kai lose what is left of his light to travel in the dark of Lahti's world? When he gets close to the truth and finds out what happened to his Maria, Kai s world is turned upside down. Now no longer knowing who to trust, everything he believed in lies in tatters around him, Kai is about to become a potential pawn in a larger game to rule the city.<br><br>As the battle for control heats up between the syndicate groups of Sarte and Mynah, so too does the intensity between Lahti and Kai. When an old friend crosses his path and pleads with him to leave the road he has chosen, will Kai be swayed to part from Lahti? With dangerous factions getting ready for war, assassins on the prowl, it is far more than love that is on the line in this riveting story.<br><br>If the names Lahti and Kai seem familiar to you as well as the terms Sarte and Mynah, then you may have already guessed that this is a prequel to Steal Moon. Only being two volumes in length, the series moves through shocks and revelations quickly, but not too quickly. It gives time for the emotional impact to take root in the character and affect the reader, proving to be an involving read. With all its elements of cat and mouse danger, it is a manga that will be a must read for fans of Yellow let alone anyone familiar with Makoto Tateno s gorgeous artwork. --Active Anime</p><h2>The Flowers of Evil (Wesleyan Poetry Series)</h2><p>The poetic masterpiece of the great nineteenth-century writer Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil is one of the most frequently read and studied works in the French language. In this compelling new translation of Baudelaire&#39;s most famous collection, Keith Waldrop recasts the poet&#39;s original French alexandrines and other poetic arrangements into versets, a form that hovers between poetry and prose. Maintaining Baudelaire&#39;s complex view of sound and structure, Waldrop&#39;s translation mirrors the intricacy of the original without attempting to replicate its inimitable verse. The result is a powerful new re-imagining, one that is, almost paradoxically, closer to Baudelaire&#39;s own poetry than any previous English translation. Including the six poems banned from the first edition, this Flowers of Evil preserves the complexity, eloquence, and dark humor of its author. Brought here to new life, it is hypnotic, frank, and forceful.</p><p>In the annals of literature, few volumes of poetry have achieved the influence and notoriety of &#39;The Flowers of Evil (Les Fleurs dur Mal) by Charles Baudelaire (1821-67). Banned and slighted in his lifetime, the book that contains all of Baudelaire&#39;s verses has opened up vistas to the imagination and quickened sensibilities of poets everywhere.CHARLES BAUDELAIRE (1821&#x2013;;1867) wrote some of the most innovative poetry of the nineteenth century, in books including Les Fleurs du Mal and Le spleen de Paris. KEITH WALDROP is author of numerous collections of poetry and is the translator of The Selected Poems of Edmond Jab�s, as well as works by Claude Royet-Journoud, Anne-Marie Albiach, and Jean Grosjean.</p><h2>The Baker&#39;s Boy</h2><p>paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>J.

This was centuries before chocolate was consumed in generally unsweetened liquid form and used as currency by the Maya, and the Aztecs after them. The Spanish conquest of Central America introduced chocolate to Europe, where it first became the drink of kings and aristocrats and then was popularized in coffeehouses. Industrialization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries made chocolate a food for the masses, and now, in our own time, it has become once again a luxury item.<br><br> The second edition draws on recent research and genetic analysis to update the information on the origins of the chocolate tree and early use by the Maya and others, and there is a new section on the medical and nutritional benefits of chocolate. 100 illustrations, 15 in color</p><p>The Coes, both anthropologists with a culinary bent, delve deeply into the history of their mouth-watering subject. The material on ancient cultures is particularly fascinating--did you know that the Maya used unsweetened liquid chocolate as currency? And in a chapter called &#34;Chocolate for the Masses,&#34; they detail the modernization of chocolate manufacture, which has allowed more than 25 million Hershey&#39;s Kisses to roll off the conveyor belt each day.<p><strong>Sophie D.

You're covering the Parade of Lights tonight, right? It's a pretty big deal in Whitehorse. You sure you don't mind shooting it, too?"<br><br>"No problem." She didn't bring up the name thing. It was possible, she realized, that Mark Sanders had told someone who she was thinking no one in Whitehorse, Montana, would care let alone cause her any trouble.<br><br>"I've got it covered," she assured him, imagining what her best friend back at the television station in Fort Worth would say if he knew she was covering parades for a small-town weekly newspaper, taking the photographs as well as writing the stories.<br><br>She hadn't talked to Bradley since she'd left Texas. Maybe she'd call him. She was sure he was probably worried about her since he'd tried to talk her out of coming up here. She missed him and hadn't wanted to call until things were going better. She didn't want to hear him say I-told-you-so. Even though he was right. She feared this move had been a huge mistake.<br><br>But she had some time to kill before the Parade of Lights and she really needed her friend.<br><br>"Hello?"<br><br>Just the sound of Bradley's voice brought tears to her eyes.<br><br>"Hello?" The apprehension she heard in his voice surprised and worried her.<br><br>"It's me," she said quickly. "Are you all right?"<br><br>"Hey." Instantly he sounded like his old self again. "I'm fine. I just thought it was someone else calling. I've been getting some obscene telephone calls. I might enjoy them if I was straight," he said with a laugh. "I am so glad you called. I have been worried to death about you. I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me."<br><br>"No chance of that," she said, tucking her feet up under her. It was almost like old times talking with him over a delivery pizza and old movies.<br><br>"So how bad is it?" he asked.<br><br>"It's...interesting."<br><br>"I told you not to take that job. You must be bored to tears. You haven't been banished, you know. You can get on the next plane and be back in Texas in a matter of hours. I'll pick you up at the airport."<br><br>She laughed. It was tempting. <br><br>"So how horrible is it in the wild, wild West?" he asked. "You can tell me."<br><br>"It's freezing cold for starters."<br><br>"I know. I confess I've been watching the weather. I knew you were going to freeze your cute little behind off." He laughed. "Seriously, how are you?"<br><br>"Homesick for you, for warm weather, for Mexican food." She smiled. "There isn't any in Whitehorse."<br><br>"Imagine that," he said with a smile in his voice.<br><br>"So how are things at the station?"<br><br>"It's been bloody hell. There was practically a revolt over your job even though everyone knew the position was only temporary."<br><br>Her boss had promised to hold her job for six months. <br><br>"So who got it? Anyone I know?"<br><br>Bradley let out a dramatic sigh and she knew. <br><br>"Rachel," she said. Rachel was as close a female friend as she'd had at the station. "I'm happy for her."<br><br>"Oh, please," Bradley said. "You can be honest. It's me, remember?"<br><br>Andi laughed. It felt good. "You're just jealous because she won't let you try on her shoes."<br><br>"I miss you."<br><br>"I miss you, too." She hated to ask, but she had to. "Has the station received any more threats addressed to me?"<br><br>That telltale beat of silence, then, "I made sure they were turned over to the police."<br><br>Hearing this surprised her. She'd thought the threats would stop once she wasn't on the air anymore.<br><br>"I'll bug the cops until they find this freak and lock him up so you can come home."<br><br>She smiled through her tears. "You're a good friend." She hung up, glad she'd called him. She felt better about her decision to come to Montana. If the television station was still getting threatening letters for her, she was much better off being as far away from Fort Worth as she could get.<br><br>As she started to file away the news article about the woman who'd died in the single-car accident, she stopped to read it through again, still curious why anyone would have sent it to her.<br><br>The deceased woman, Grace Jackson, had apparently been driving at a high rate of speed when she'd lost control of her car south of town. The car had rolled numerous times before landing in a ravine where it had caught fire.<br><br>As she had the first time she'd read it, Andi shuddered at the thought of the poor woman being trapped in the vehicle and burning to death. There were so few vehicles on the roads up here and miles between ranches let alone towns. Even if the car hadn't burned, the woman probably would have died before someone had come along.<br><br>According to the article, Grace Jackson had been married to a Cade Jackson. Wasn't the sheriff's name Jackson? Carter Jackson, as she recalled from reading back papers to familiarize herself with the town.<br><br>She wondered if Cade and Carter were related. Pretty good chance given their names. The sheriff's name had come up quite a lot in the news&#x2014;including the murder of the reporter who'd had this desk, Glen Whitaker.<br><br>She looked again at the manila envelope the newspaper clipping and tape had come in, checking to make sure there wasn't a note that she'd missed. Nothing. The envelope had been mailed in Whitehorse so at least it was from someone local.<br><br>She filed the story, still a little anxious, though, that at least one person in town knew her other name.<br><br>As she pocketed the cassette tape, she wondered where she could find a tape player.<br><br>The parade of Lights definitely was an event in Whitehorse, Montana. Andi stood on a curb with the rest of the county that had turned out, everyone bundled up for the cold, snowy December night, as one homemade float after another cruised by.<br><br>The air was filled with excitement, the stores along the main street open and lit brightly for the event. The smell of Christmas trees, hot cider and Native American fry bread wafted in the chilly air.<br><br>The streets were packed with not only townspeople, but also apparently ranchers and their families had come in from miles around for the event.<br><br>Andi shot a dozen photographs of the floats, surprised at how many there were given the temperature and how much work had gone into some of them.<br><br>She liked the small-town feel, which surprised her. It felt like an extended family as she heard people visiting and calling greetings from the floats.<br><br>Just as she was finishing up, she heard someone call out, "Cade!"<br><br>She looked up to see an attractive woman waving from one of the floats. Andi followed the woman's gaze to a man leaning against the building yards to her right. She could see only his profile, his face in shadow under the brim of his Western hat, but he was tall and all cowboy. He wore boots, jeans, a sheepskin coat and a Stetson, the brim pulled low, dark hair curling out from under the hat at his nape.<br><br>From the way he stood, back in the shadows, she got the impression he had hoped to go unnoticed.<br><br>Cade Jackson? The husband of the deceased woman from the newspaper clipping?<br><br>Andi lifted the camera and impulsively snapped his photograph. As she pulled the camera down, he disappeared into the crowd.<br><br>Cold and tired, she returned to the newspaper office just down the block, anxious to get her photographs into the computer. Warmer, she decided to go ahead and write up her story even though it was late.<br><br>She knew she was just avoiding the small apartment she'd rented on the other side of town. It wasn't far from the newspaper given that Whitehorse was only ten blocks square. She usually drove to work out of habit more than necessity, although she didn't relish walking through all the snow.<br><br>The apartment was small and impersonal to the point of being depressing. In time she would make it hers, but right now she preferred the newspaper office to home.<br><br>After she put in the photographs and wrote cutlines for each, she sat down at the computer to write an accompanying article.<br><br>Her mind wandered, though, and she found herself calling up the photograph of the cowboy she'd seen on the main street tonight, the one the woman had called Cade. How many Cades could there be in Whitehorse?<br><br>The publisher had said Cade Jackson and his wife, Grace, had only been married a short period of time before her death. That meant there should be a wedding announcement in the file, she thought, unable to shake her curiosity as to why someone had sent the cassette and clipping to her.<br><br></p><h2>Mrs. Marlowe&#39;s Mice</h2><p>Meet Mrs. Eleanor Marlowe, a young widow who lives in an apartment by herself -- not counting the extended family of mice who secretly live with her. Harboring mice is a very serious offense in Cat City. Why would a mild-mannered widow run such a risk? The neighbors wonder why Mrs. Marlowe never invites anyone over for catnip tea. Her secret little friends are beginning to wonder about their host, too. So fine is the cheese she serves that some of Mrs. Marlowe&#39;s mice wonder if she&#39;s fattening them up for the kill. One day, officers from the Department of Catland Security show up at Mrs. Marlowe&#39;s door, demanding to search the premises.

The Lumbee Tribe is the largest tribe in North Carolina. They take their name from the Lumbee River which winds its way through Robeson County. The ancestors of the Lumbee were mainly Cheraw and related Siouan-speaking Indians. One of the favorite activities of the many Lumbee families was sharing stories around the fire at night. More recently, Lumbee storytellers such as Barbara Braveboy Locklear, Barbara Locklear, Mardella Lowry, and Nora Dial-Stanley, carry on this ancient storytelling tradition to a much broader audience. The ancestors of the Lumbee tribe shared many stories with other local tribes such as the Cherokee, Creek, and Catawba. As the Lumbee people shared stories, they found that their sister tribes also told tales about &#34;little wild spirit people&#34;, animals, the afterlife, and how our world came to be.</p><p></p><h2>Thoughts &amp; Feelings: Taking Control of Your Moods and Your Life: A Workbook of Cognitive Behavioral Techniques</h2><p>An innovative twelve-step program assists in preventing negative thoughts from permeating the mind and provides methods to deal with worry, panic disorder, perfectionism, obsessive thinking, phobia, depression, low self-esteem, shame and guilt, anger, and other problems.

Women know how to date . . . It's men who need the help! At last: a blithe, bold, and bawdy guide to building a better boyfriend</strong> <p>At some point, every guy -- player, geek, mama's boy, "regular Joe" -- meets a woman who makes him want to be a boyfriend. A good boyfriend. Problem is, unless he's had some first-rate training (by a previous girlfriend, a sister, a mom), he probably doesn't even know what that means. Felicity Huffman and Patricia Wolff come to the rescue with a rollicking -- and whip-smart -- handbook to navigating the minefield of male-female relationships. </p> <p>Directed at men (though of course it's women who'll buy it, then leave it at their boyfriend's place -- accidentally on purpose), <em>A Practical Handbook for the Boyfriend</em> lays out the many steps involved in becoming a good boyfriend, while still maintaining guy-dignity. It covers issues like: </p> <p>-Who decides when you become a boyfriend (answer: She does.) -How to look like you're listening, even when you're not (If you're busted, just say "You're so pretty, I'm distracted.") -Ten things never to say on the first date (#4: "I just did that to freak you out.") -Finding the middle ground between too cool (think third grade) and too eager (think surprise visits) -Why becoming a good boyfriend is a lot like training for the A team </p> <p>Filled with humor, ribaldry, common sense, and assorted outdoor skills, <em>A Practical Handbook for the Boyfriend</em> is the next dating guide to dominate the bestseller lists. </p></p><p><strong>Felicity Huffman</strong> won an Emmy in 2005 for her portrayal of Lynette Scavo on TV's hit series <em>Desperate Housewives</em>.

Patricia lives in Los Angeles with her son, Jack, and is an associate producer with Center Theatre Group.Does it take a Desperate Housewife (Huffman) and a theatrical producer (Wolff) to save potential and current boyfriends from themselves? Perhaps. In this blunt and funny primer for clueless males, narrator Shelley Frasier delivers the sometimes bawdy, irreverent, and even gross content without a hitch. The work is intended mostly for the All-American male--one who wouldnt touch chardonnay or quiche, who is basically incapable of a trace of suaveness or intellectualism, and who is stuck in a post-frat-house mentality. Still, there are some truths that every male can use in his relationships, though feminists may cringe at the traditional gender positioning the authors assume. But if one takes it in the spirit intended, this handbook is a fun romp through meat-and-potatoes American love.

Not just a chronicle of biology&#x2019;s progress from gene to genome in one hundred years, <i>The Century of the Gene</i> also calls our attention to the surprising ways these advances challenge the familiar picture of the gene most of us still entertain.<br>Keller shows us that the very successes that have stirred our imagination have also radically undermined the primacy of the gene&#x2015;word and object&#x2015;as the core explanatory concept of heredity and development. She argues that we need a new vocabulary that includes concepts such as robustness, fidelity, and evolvability. But more than a new vocabulary, a new awareness is absolutely crucial: that understanding the components of a system (be they individual genes, proteins, or even molecules) may tell us little about the interactions among these components.<br>With the Human Genome Project nearing its first and most publicized goal, biologists are coming to realize that they have reached not the end of biology but the beginning of a new era. Indeed, Keller predicts that in the new century we will witness another Cambrian era, this time in new forms of biological thought rather than in new forms of biological life.</p><p>We've been under the spell of DNA for too long. Science historian and MacArthur Fellow Evelyn Fox Keller makes the case for radically new thinking about the nature of heredity in <i>The Century of the Gene</i>. This short, magisterial treatise examines 100 years of genetic thinking and finds outdated elements of Victorian beliefs still permeating our scientific writing. Despite compelling evidence that cytoplasmic and other nonchromosomal factors play important roles in development and even in the inheritance of traits, most discussion still relies on the master-slave (or manager-worker) relationship between the nucleus and the cell. Keller wants to move on; her proximate goal is to proceed from talking about genes to talking about genetic talk, the better to understand our biases. Her excitement at developments such as the Human Genome Project, despite her initial doubts, is only heightened by the prospect of vast stretches of uncharted intellectual territory. Ultimately, of course, her program matches that of the scientific enterprise--to more fully understand ourselves and our world. What comes after <i>The Century of the Gene</i>? It's an excellent question, and one that can only be answered once we leave behind the baggage of the past. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Evelyn Fox Keller is Professor Emerita of History and Philosophy of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Each stage in its development, from its birth as a small village 3000 years ago, through its uncertain future in the late 20th century, is examined in double-page spreads. For each time period, a detailed architectural rendering provides a panoramic view of San Rafael and the surrounding area. A half-page inset then diagrams that scene, identifying land usages, buildings, and infrastructure. Text and additional pen-and-ink illustrations explain other aspects of Mayan society that, after rising out of the jungle to glory, collapsed in ruin to emerge as a mixture of Spanish colonialism and New World cultures. The text is brief but clearly written, offering readers a great deal of information in a small amount of space. Although most children will be fascinated by the intricate detail, some may be confused by the terrain analysis and overwhelmed by the volume of textual and visual material. There is no glossary to explain the sophisticated vocabulary and concepts, and the index is nothing more than a table of contents.

A famous songwriting duo is destroyed by their creative differences, a jazz musician is consumed by his inability to speak or play, a man takes a pop song literally and charts his love onto buildings. These stories cover songs and riff on melodies. They unearth chords that bridge the gap between past and present. A playful, elegant debut collection, The Great American Songbook explores the profound hold that music has on our lives.</p><p>Sam Allingham grew up in rural New Jersey and Philadelphia. After graduating from Oberlin College, he worked for many years as a music teacher for adults and small(ish) children, before receiving an MFA from Temple University in 2013. His work has appeared in One Story, American Short Fiction, Epoch, n+1, The Millions, and Full Stop, among other publications. He currently lives in West Philadelphia and teaches at Temple University."By turns hilarious and deeply unnerving, deadpan and visionary, disorienting yet disturbingly familiar, the stories in The Great American Songbook ride a path between waking life and a fever dream.

Luckily, they have the outrageously talented Sam Allingham to guide them through these wonderfully sharp pages, where the strange becomes familiar, and the familiar strange, in a way that feels both honest and true&#x2015;prying open the hinges on that old, rusted box of the human condition, and providing a map (and maybe even a song or two) as assassins and nut jobs and struggling teenagers smash their clarinets, let the birds out of their cages, shout into the night sky across desert canyons, and navigate the distance between loneliness and love."&#x2015;Hannah Tinti, author of The Good Thief</p><h2>High-Spirited Women of the West</h2><p>Profiles of ten courageous women who helped shape history are told in this inspiring and entertaining book.

The author also describes in detail the personal life of Lenin: his family antecedents, his private finances, the early funding of the Bolshevik Party, his relationship with his mistress Inessa Armand, and the illness that crippled the final months of his life.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianAt KGB headquarters in Moscow, classified files were always carefully marked with the words khranit' vechno - to be preserved forever. For years, Westerners have wondered what secrets were preserved in the KGB archives and in dozens of other off-limits locations. Now that Dmitri Volkogonov, historian and former general in the Soviet Army, has been entrusted with the management of the archives as a special assistant to Boris Yeltsin, we know. For the past three years Volkogonov has combed through more than 3,700 once-secret documents covering every piece of information in the archive system concerning Vladimir Ilyitch Lenin. Volkogonov has woven this mountain of information into a compelling story of the Soviet founding father and the system he created, and offers a radical departure from the traditional interpretation of Lenin. He demonstrates that many of the characteristics of so-called Stalinism were firmly laid down in Lenin's lifetime, usually on Lenin's direct orders. From the creation of concentration camps to brutal repression of the church and the media, to a strategic formation of a cult of personality, Lenin's leadership was cruel and totalitarian. And with select revelations from the post-Lenin years, Volkogonov shows that all the worst excesses of the Soviet state had their roots in its founding father. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Gaff Rig Handbook</h2><p>Used.

White-on-white or a splash of brilliant color? Just like clothes make the man, fabric makes the furniture. House Beautiful understands that, and so the editors are letting sofas, chairs, settees, ottomans, lampshades, and more put on a &#x201c;fashion show.&#x201d; As in the magazine feature, beautiful photographs display every piece of furniture covered in several different fabrics; with each change of material, the item&#x2019;s appearance is transformed. The magazine&#x2019;s experts explain exactly how the choice of color and pattern affects the furniture&#x2019;s appearance. For example, stripes on a sofa highlight the couch&#x2019;s shape and give it a contemporary flair, while a floral pattern de-emphasizes the form and adds traditional country charm. A range of sofa and chair styles are included, as well as ottomans, benches, chaises, curtains, lampshades, fabric-covered headboards, and more. With details on fabric content, technical terms, decorating pitfalls, and upholstering tips, this is the ideal reference. <i>A Main Selection of the Homestyle Book Club.</i><br></p><p>Following the maxim "form follows function," Dellatore offers readers advice on choosing home fabrics that will not only fit their individual tastes but also suit their domestic needs. The book is a spin-off of the House Beautiful "Swatch Watch" column, which is dedicated solely to fabric talk, and the wide array of furniture and interiors captured here are pleasingly laid out to reflect a multitude of aesthetic tastes. Dellatore, owner of an upholstery and curtain-making firm in New York City, takes furniture staples-such as loveseats, wing chairs and trestle benches-and wraps them in whimsical patterns to demonstrate how different moods and styles can be achieved by fabric applications. He also tackles related topics, such as fabric treatments for windows and "small touches" like tablecloths and folding screens. One of the most magical pieces is a plain metal shelf unit transformed into an elegant moveable closet with a few bits of colorful fabric and some grosgrain ribbon trim. With practical tips on upholstering (e.g. align those stripes when nailing down material) and more creative suggestions on decorating ("to make horizontal furniture look taller, use...vertical patterns, and add contrasting pillows to draw in the eye"), this book gives readers a chance to get a professional's advice without paying the professional rate. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I lost my wife Pat. </p><p> It took six long, tortured months for her to die. </p><p> I had to stand by and watch my beautiful, perfect wife waste away until there was nothing left. It didn't matter that I have money and success. It didn't matter that I'm called an "important" writer. It didn't matter that Pat and I had finally started building our dream house, an engineering miracle that hung onto a cliff wall and would allow us to sit quietly and look out across the Pacific. </p><p> Nothing at all mattered from the moment Pat came home and interrupted me while I was writing -- something she never did -- to tell me that she had cancer, and that it was in an advanced stage. I thought it was one of her jokes. Pat had a quirky sense of humor; she said I was too serious, too morose, too doom-and-gloom, and too afraid of everything on earth. From the first, she'd made me laugh. </p><p> We met at college. Two more different people would be hard to find, and even Pat's family was completely alien to me. I'd seen families like hers on television, but it never occurred to me that they actually existed. </p><p> She lived in a pretty little house with a front porch and -- I swear this is true -- a white picket fence. On summer evenings her parents -- Martha and Edwin -- would sit on the front porch and wave at the neighbors as they passed by. Her mother would wear an apron and snap green beans or shell peas while she waved and chatted. "How is Tommy today?" she'd ask some passerby. "Is his cold better?" </p><p> Pat's father sat just a few feet away from his wife at a wrought iron table, an old floor lamp nearby, and a box of gleaming German tools, all precisely arranged, at his feet. He was -- again, I swear this is true -- known as Mr. Fix-It around the neighborhood and he repaired broken things for his own family and his neighbors. Free of charge. He said he liked to help people and a smile was enough payment for him. </p><p> When I went to Pat's house to pick her up for a date, I'd go early just so I could sit and watch her parents. To me, it was like watching a science fiction movie. As soon as I arrived, Pat's mother -- "call me Martha, everyone does" -- would get up and get me something to eat and drink. "I know that growing boys need their nourishment," she'd say, then disappear inside her spotlessly clean house. </p><p> I'd sit there in silence, watching Pat's father as he worked on a toaster or maybe a broken toy. That big oak box of tools at his feet used to fascinate me. They were all perfectly clean, perfectly matched. And I knew they had to have cost a fortune. One time I was in the city -- that ubiquitous "city" that seems to lie within fifty miles of all college towns -- and I saw a hardware store across the street. Since hardware stores had only bad memories for me, it took courage on my part to cross the street, open the door, and go inside. But since I'd met Pat, I'd found that I'd become braver. Even way back then her laughter was beginning to echo in my ears, laughter that encouraged me to try things I never would have before, simply because of the painful emotions they stirred up. </p><p> As soon as I walked into the store, the air seemed to move from my lungs, up my throat, past the back of my neck, and into my head to form a wide, thick bar between my ears. There was a man in front of me and he was saying something, but that block of air inside my head kept me from hearing him. </p><p> After a while he quit talking and gave me one of those looks I'd seen so many times from my uncles and cousins. It was a look that divided men from Men. It usually preceded a fatal pronouncement like: "He don't know which end of a chain saw to use." But then, I'd always played the brain to my relatives' brawn. </p><p> After the clerk sized me up, he walked away with a little smile that only moved the left side of his thin lips. Just like my cousins and uncles, he recognized me for what I was: a person who thought about things, who read books without pictures, and liked movies that had no car chases. </p><p> I wanted to leave the hardware store. I didn't belong there and it held too many old fears for me. But I could hear Pat's laughter and it gave me courage. </p><p> "I want to buy a gift for someone," I said loudly and knew right away that I'd made a mistake. "Gift" was not a word my uncles and cousins would have used. They would have said, "I need a set a socket wrenches for my brother-in-law. What'd'ya got?" But the clerk turned and smiled at me. After all, "gift" meant money. "So what kind of gift?" he asked. </p><p> Pat's father's tools had a German name on them that I said to the man -- properly pronounced, of course (there are some advantages to an education). I was pleased to see his eyebrows elevate slightly and I felt smug: I'd impressed him. </p><p> He went behind a counter that was scarred from years of router blades and drill bits having been dropped on it, and reached below to pull out a catalog. "We don't carry those in the store but we can order whatever you want." I nodded in what I hoped was a truly manly way, trying to imply that I knew exactly what I wanted, and flipped through the catalog. The photos were full color; the paper was expensive. And no wonder since the prices were astronomical. </p><p> "Precision," the man said, summing up everything in that one word. I pressed my lower lip against the bottom of my upper teeth in a way I'd seen my uncles do a thousand times, and nodded as though I knew the difference between a "precision" screwdriver and one out of a kid's Home Depot kit. "I wouldn't have anything else," I said in that tight-lipped way my uncles spoke of all things mechanical. The glory of the words "two stroke engine" made them clamp their back teeth together so that the words were almost unintelligible. </p><p> "You can take that catalog," the man said, and my face unclenched for a moment. I almost said gleefully, "Yeah? That's kind of you." But I remembered in time to do the bottom lip gesture and mumble "much obliged" from somewhere in the back of my throat. I wished I'd had on a dirty baseball cap with the name of some sports team so I could tug at the brim in a Man's goodbye as I left the store. </p><p> When I got back to my tiny, gray apartment off campus later that night, I looked up some of Pat's father's tools in the catalog. Those tools of his were worth thousands. Not hundreds. Thousands. </p><p> But he left that oak box out on the porch every night. Unlocked. Unguarded. </p><p> The next day when I saw Pat between classes -- she was studying chemistry and I was English lit -- I mentioned the tools to her as casually as possible. She wasn't fooled; she knew this was important to me. "Why do you always fear the worst?" she asked, smiling. "Possessions don't matter, only people do." "You should tell that to my uncle Reg," I said, trying to make a joke. The smile left her pretty face. "I'd love to," she said. </p><p> Pat wasn't afraid of anything. But because I didn't want her to look at me differently, I wouldn't introduce her to my relatives. Instead, I let myself pretend that I was part of her family, the one that had big Thanksgiving dinners, and Christmases with eggnog and gifts under the tree. "Is it me or my family you love?" Pat once asked, smiling, but her eyes were serious. "Is it me or my rotten childhood you love?" I shot back, and we smiled at each other. Then my big toe went up her pants leg and the next moment we were on top of one another. </p><p> Pat and I were exotic to each other. Her sweet, loving, trusting family never failed to fascinate me. I was sitting in their living room one day waiting for Pat when her mother came home with her arms pulled down by the weight of four shopping bags. Back then I didn't know that I should have jumped up and helped her with them. Instead, I just stared at her. </p><p> "Ford," she said (my father's eldest brother thought he was bestowing a blessing on me when he named me after his favorite pickup), "I didn't see you sitting there. But I'm glad you're here because you're just the person I wanted to see." </p><p> What she was saying was ordinary to her. Pat and her parents easily and casually said things to make other people feel good. "That's just your color," Pat's mother would say to an ugly woman. "You should wear that color every day. And who does your hair?" From someone else, the words would have been facetious. But any compliment Pat's mother -- I could never call her "Martha" or "Mrs. Pendergast" -- gave came out sincere-sounding because it <i>was</i> sincere. </p><p> She put the shopping bags down by the coffee table, removed the pretty arrangement of fresh flowers she'd cut from her backyard garden, and began pulling little squares of cloth out of the bags. I'd never seen anything like them before and had no idea what they were. But then Pat's parents were always introducing me to new and wondrous things. </p><p> When Pat's mother had spread all the pieces of cloth out on the glass-topped coffee table (my cousins would have considered it a matter of pride to break that glass, and my uncles would have dropped their work boot-clad feet on it with malicious little smiles) she looked up at me and said, "Which do you like?" </p><p> I wanted to ask why she cared what I thought, but back then I was constantly trying to make Pat's parents believe that I'd grown up in a world like theirs. I looked at the fabric pieces and saw that each one was different. There were pieces with big flowers on them, and some with little flowers. There were stripes, solids, and some with blue line drawings. </p><p> When I looked up at Pat's mother, I could see she was expecting me to say something. But what? Was it a trick? If I chose the wrong one would she tell me to leave the house and never see Pat again? It was what I feared every minute I was with them. I was fascinated by their sheer niceness, but at the same time they scared me. What would they do if they found out that inside I was no more like their daughter than a scorpion was like a ladybug? </p><p> Pat saved me. When she came into the living room, her hands pulling her thick blonde hair up into a ponytail, she saw me looking at her mother, my eyes wild with the fear of being found out. "Oh, Mother," Pat said. "Ford doesn't know anything about upholstery fabrics. He can recite Chaucer in the original English, so what does he need to know about chintz and toile?" </p><p> <i>"Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote,"</i> I murmured, smiling at Pat. Two weeks before I'd found out that if I whispered Chaucer while I was biting on her earlobe, it made her wild for sex. Like her father, an accountant, she had a mathematician's brain, and anything poetic excited her. </p><p> I looked back at the fabrics. Ah. Upholstery. I made a mental note to look up the words "chintz" and "toile." And later I'd have to ask Pat why being able to recite medieval poetry should exclude knowledge of upholstery fabrics. "What do you plan to upholster?" I asked Pat's mother, hoping I sounded familiar with the subject. </p><p> "The whole room," Pat said in exasperation. "She redoes the entire living room every four years. New slipcovers, new curtains, everything. And she sews all of it herself." </p><p> "Ah," I said, looking about the room. Every piece of furniture and all the windows were covered in shades of pink and green -- or rose and moss as Pat later told me. </p><p> "I think I'll go Mediterranean," Pat's mother said. "Terra cotta and brick. I was thinking of trying my hand at leather upholstery with all those little nails around the edge. What do you think of that idea, Ford? Would that look nice?" </p><p> I could only blink at her. In the many houses I had lived in, new furniture was bought only when there were holes in the old, and price was the only consideration for purchase. One of my aunts had a whole set of furniture covered in three-inch-long purple acrylic. Everyone thought it was wonderful because all three pieces had cost only twenty-five dollars. Only I minded having to remove long purple fibers from my food. </p><p> "Mediterranean is nice," I said, feeling as proud of myself as though I'd just penned the Declaration of Independence. </p><p> "There," Pat's mother said to her daughter. "He does know about upholstery." </p><p> Pulling the little hair tie out of her mouth, Pat deftly wrapped it around her ponytail, and rolled her eyes. Three weekends before, her parents had visited a sick relative so Pat and I'd spent two nights alone in their house. We'd played at being married, at being our own little family, and that that perfect house was ours. We'd sat at the kitchen table and shucked corn, then we'd eaten dinner at the mahogany dining table -- just like grown-ups. I'd told Pat a lot about my childhood, but I'd only told her the deep angst part, the part that was likely to get me sympathy and sex. I'd not told her the mundane, day-to-day things, such as rarely eating meals not in front of a TV, never having used a cloth napkin, and only using candles when the electric bill hadn't been paid. It was odd, but telling her that my father was in prison and that my mother had used me to punish my father's brothers made me seem heroic, while asking her what the hell an artichoke was made me feel like the village idiot. </p><p> The second night we spent together in her parents' house, I lit a fire in the fireplace, Pat sat on the floor between my legs, and I brushed her beautiful hair. </p><p> So, later, when she looked at me over her mother's head, I knew she was remembering the night we'd made love on the carpet in front of the fire. And from the looks she was giving me, I knew that if we didn't get out of there soon I'd be throwing her down on top of her mother's fabric samples. "You're so <i>alive,"</i> Pat had said to me. "So primitive. So <i>real."</i> I didn't like the "primitive" part but if it turned her on... </p><p> "You two go on," Pat's mother said, smiling and seeming to intuit what Pat and I were feeling. And, as always, she was unselfish and thinking of others before herself. When the drunk teenager who killed her a few years later was pulled from his car, he said, "What's the big deal? She was just an old woman." </p><p> * </p><p> Pat and I were married for twenty-one years before she was taken from me. Twenty-one years sounds like a long time, but it was only minutes. Right after we graduated from college, one of the teaching jobs she was offered paid exceptionally well, but it was in an inner city school. "Hazard pay," the man on the phone who was begging her to take the job said. "It's a rough school, and last year one of our teachers was knifed. She recovered but she wears a colostomy bag now." He waited for this to sink in, waited for Pat to slam down the phone. </p><p> But he didn't know my wife, didn't know what her boundless optimism could take on. I wanted to try my hand at a novel, she wanted to give me the chance to write, and the money was excellent so she took the job. </p><p> It was difficult for me to understand such selfless love as hers, and I was always trying to figure out the why of it. Sometimes it would run through my head that Pat loved me because of my childhood, not in spite of it. If I were the same man but had grown up in an orderly house li...</p></p><h2>Signs of Meaning in the Universe (Advances in Semiotics)</h2><p><p>From reviews for the bestselling Danish edition:</p><p>"... dashing and idiomatic language that is a pleasure to read." &#x2015;Berlingske Tidende</p><p>"... an appetizer and eye opener...

What propels this journey is Hoffmeyer&#x2019;s attempt to discover how nature could come to mean something to someone&#x2015;by telling the story of how cells, tissue, organs, plants, animals, even entire ecosystems communicate by signs and signals. </p></p><p>Jesper Hoffmeyer is on to something significant. Whereas semiotics is often a dull analysis of formal symbols, Hoffmeyer's biosemiotics is a lively natural history of signs that interprets evolution as a continuous advance in semiotic freedom. All living things, according to Hoffmeyer, are constantly reacting to their environment by interpreting the signs in their own <i>unwelt,</i>, or interior representation of the surrounding world. Freedom and chaotic self-organization thus become the hallmarks of all life. Based on sound research and written in a delightfully accessible style, <i>Signs of Meaning in the Universe</i> should be interpreted as an advance in both philosophy and science.For three and a half billion years the living creatures of the natural world have been engaged in an increasingly complex and extensive conversation. Cells, tissue, organs, plants, animals, entire populations and ecosystems buzz with communication, incessantly emitting and receiving signals. These signs have been there as long as life itself. They make up the semiosphere, a sphere like the biosphere, but one constituted of messages - sounds, odors, movements, colors, electrical fields, chemical signals - the signs of life. This book examines the radical premise that the sign, not the molecule, is the crucial, underlying factor in the study of life. On this tour of the universe of signs, Jesper Hoffmeyer travels back to the Big Bang, visits the tiniest places deep within cells, and ends his journey with us - complex organisms capable of speech and reason. He shows that life at its most basic depends on the survival of messages written in the code of DNA molecules, and on the tiny cell - the fertilized egg - that must interpret the message and from it construct an organism. What propels this journey is Hoffmeyer&#39;s attempt to discover how nature could come to mean something to someone; indeed, how &#34;&#34;something&#34;&#34; could become &#34;&#34;someone&#34;&#34;. How could a biological self become a semiotic self? And how, finally, do we unite these two different selves, &#34;&#34;nature&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;mind&#34;&#34; which we all carry in us and which all too often are at war with each other?</p><h2>The Buried Girl: A Novel of Suspense</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Taut, propulsive and darkly gripping, Montanari is a master of suspense.&#x201d; &#x2013;Chris Ewan</p><p><strong>A haunting, nerve-jangling psychological thriller from&nbsp;<em>Sunday Times </em>bestselling author Richard Montanari, set in a small town hiding a very dark secret</strong><br><br>New York psychologist Will Hardy had it all&#x2014;a loving family, a flourishing career, a bestselling book.

Trained as a doctor at Columbia University, he contracted tuberculosis during his internship as a pathologist at Bellevue Hospital and spent the next three years recovering, primarily in TB sanitoriums. This collection of essays explores not only Percy&#x2019;s connections to medicine but also the underappreciated impact his art has had&#x2014;and can have&#x2014;on medicine itself.<br> The contributors&#x2014;physicians, philosophers, and literary critics&#x2014;examine the relevance of Percy&#x2019;s work to current dilemmas in medical education and health policy. They reflect upon the role doctors and patients play in his novels, his family legacy of depression, how his medical background influenced his writing style, and his philosophy of psychiatry. They contemplate the private ways in which Percy&#x2019;s work affected their own lives and analyze the author&#x2019;s tendency to contrast the medical-scientific worldview with a more spiritual one. Assessing Percy&#x2019;s stature as an author and elucidating the many ways that reading and writing can combine with diagnosing and treating to offer an antidote to despair, they ask what it means to be a doctor, a writer, and a seeker of cures and truths&#x2014;not just for the body but for the malaise and diseased spirituality of modern times. <br> This collection will appeal to lovers of literature as well as medical professionals&#x2014;indeed, anyone concerned with medical ethics and the human side of doctoring.<i><p></p></i><p><i>Contributors</i>.

Now Mengestu enriches the themes that defined his debut with a heartbreaking literary masterwork about love, family, and the power of imagination, which confirms his reputation as one of the brightest talents of his generation.</p><p>One early September afternoon, Yosef and Mariam, young Ethiopian immigrants who have spent all but their first year of marriage apart, set off on a road trip from their new home in Peoria, Illinois, to Nashville, Tennessee, in search of a new identity as an American couple. Soon, their son, Jonas, will be born in Illinois. Thirty years later, Yosef has died, and Jonas needs to make sense of the volatile generational and cultural ties that have forged him. How can he envision his future without knowing what has come before? Leaving behind his marriage and job in New York, Jonas sets out to retrace his mother and father's trip and weave together a family history that will take him from the war-torn Ethiopia of his parents' youth to his life in the America of today, a story&#x2014;real or invented&#x2014;that holds the possibility of reconciliation and redemption.</p><p>Watch a Video</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: Early on in <em>How to Read the Air</em>--the second novel from the author of the widely acclaimed debut, <em>The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears</em>--Jonas Woldemariam and his soon-to-be wife Angela attend a party, where they tell casual, false stories about Angela's absent father and arrive, all of a sudden, at the fulcrum of this elegant and unusual novel. "To them," Angela notes, "it's all just one story told over and over. Change the dates and the names but it's the same." It's a theme that Dinaw Mengestu revisits as he selects the chapters from many different stories that converge in Jonas. Chief among them is Yosef and Mariam's story: they are Jonas's Ethiopian parents, estranged from each other in a violent, loveless marriage, each striving more for America's security than for its dreams. Mengestu takes common ideals of how we're supposed to live--ranging from the importance of material progress to the popular notion that there's nothing more American than road trips and country music--and investigates them quite beautifully in characters who are genuine and visionary and do, as Jonas notes, "persist, whether we care to or not, with all our flaws and glory." --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em>Dinaw Mengestu was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1978.

Bodie's goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life. Reading opened the world to me. I began to write stories of my own." </p> <p>By the young age of fourteen, Bodie had a job as a stringer reporter for The California Newspaper. "They paid me fifty cents an inch for one article a week. The most I ever made was twelve dollars, but I felt rich!"</p> <p>Bodie continued her college education as a Journalism-Political Science major in San Jose, California. She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches."</p> <p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!"</p> <p>Publication of <i>The Fall Guy</i> catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim. Shortly after that she went to work for John Wayne's Batjac Productions and ABC Television as a writer and researcher, working with the top writers in the motion picture industry.

Her work is currently featured in <i>American West, Saturday Evening Post, </i>and <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine, as well as other national publications. </p> <p>Bodie's interest in Israel, which culminated in THE ZION CHRONICLES, stems from her days as a student. In 1978 she spoke to John Wayne about her hope to one day write a novel about the exciting events surrounding the rebirth of Israel. He encouraged her with his reply: "That's one you ought to do.

This view was challenged by the world&#x2019;s three largest countries, India, China and Russia, who saw the bombing of Serbia and Kosovo as a naked attempt to assert US dominance in an unstable world.<br><br>In the West, media networks were joined by substantial sectors of left/liberal opinion in supporting the war. Nonetheless, a wide variety of figures emerged to challenge the prevailing consensus. Their work, gathered here for the first time, forms a collection of key statements and anti-war writings from some of democracy&#x2019;s most eloquent dissidents&#x2014;Noam Chomsky, Harold Pinter, Edward Said and many others&#x2014;who provide carefully researched examinations of the real motives for the US action, dissections and critiques of the ideology of &#x2018;humanitarian warfare&#x2019;, and chartings of the unnecessary tragedy of a region laid to waste in the pursuance of Great Power politics.<br><br>This reader presents some of the most important texts on NATO&#x2019;s Balkan crusade and forms a major intervention in the debate on global geo-political strategy after the Cold War.</p><p>The essays in this book on the Balkans, notes editor Tariq Ali in his introduction, "share one common approach to the region: all regard the break-up of Yugoslavia as a major European disaster." They are also uniformly and often vituperatively negative when it comes to NATO's 1999 war against Serbia. This event dominates the book, and the contributors have nothing good to say about it. The war gave a "green light" for Russia to assault Chechnya ("Could it be that this is Moscow's reward for helping to end the war in Kosovo?"), intensified poor relations between India and Pakistan, and made China more aggressive toward Taiwan and Tibet. Ali even asserts that the Chinese embassy in Belgrade--whose bombing was called an accident at the time--was "clearly included" on the NATO hit list. (Stranger still is Ali's approving quotation from Hitler's <i>Mein Kampf</i> on the subject of English media manipulation; his point is the moral equivalence of NATO's press relations and Nazi propaganda.) <p> All the views contained in <i>Masters of the Universe?</i> are way to the left of mainstream opinion; essay authors include Noam Chomsky and Edward Said. A spirit of anti-Americanism also pervades the book. Gilbert Achcar, for instance, notes "the current level of the U.S. defense budget corresponds rationally to the U.S. aspiration to imperial expansion and exclusive global hegemony." In other words, the United States fought in Kosovo because it wants to rule the world. Somewhat underscoring this claim, Ellen Meiksins Wood cites an ill-advised comment by President Clinton about Kosovo's importance: "If we're going to have a strong economic relationship that includes our ability to sell around the world, Europe has got to be a key.... That's what this Kosovo thing is all about." But, overall, the left-wing slant of the contributors of <i>Masters of the Universe?</i> makes it a less-than-balanced assessment of what has happened in the Balkans. <i>--John J.

Known collectively as Apaches, these Indians lived in diverse, widely scattered groups with many names&#x2014;Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Jicarillas, to name but three. Much has been written about them and their leaders, such as Geronimo, Juh, Nana, Victorio, and Mangas Coloradas, but no one wrote extensively about the greatest leader of them all: Cochise. Now, however, Edwin R. Sweeney has remedied this deficiency with his definitive biography.</p><p>Cochise, a Chiricahua, was said to be the most resourceful, most brutal, most feared Apache. He and his warriors raided in both Mexico and the United States, crossing the border both ways to obtain sanctuary after raids for cattle, horses, and other livestock. Once only he was captured and imprisoned; on the day he was freed he vowed never to be taken again. From that day he gave no quarter and asked none. Always at the head of his warriors in battle, he led a charmed life, being wounded several times but always surviving.</p><p>In 1861, when his brother was executed by Americans at Apache Pass, Cochise declared war. He fought relentlessly for a decade, and then only in the face of overwhelming military superiority did he agree to a peace and accept the reservation. Nevertheless, even though he was blamed for virtually every subsequent Apache depredation in Arizona and New Mexico, he faithfully kept that peace until his death in 1874.</p> Sweeney has traced Cochise�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s activities in exhaustive detail in both United States and Mexican Archives. We are not likely to learn more about Cochise than he has given us. His biography will stand as the major source for all that is yet to be written on Cochise.�&nbsp;</p><p>Retired as a professional accountant, <b>Edwin R. Sweeney</b> is an independent scholar and the author of <i>Cochise: Chiricahua Apache Chief</i>; <i>Mangas Coloradas: Chief of the Chiricahua Apaches</i>; and <i>From Cochise to Geronimo: The Chiricahua Apaches, 1874&#x2013;1886.</i>Without solid knowledge of Southwestern geography and history, readers will find themselves overwhelmed by the wealth of detail in this well-documented, exhaustive biography. For more than 40 years, Apache bands fought Mexican and American troops in the borderlands between New Mexico and Arizona, Chihuahua and Sonora. In his first book, Sweeney gives a brief introduction to the Apaches and their culture, focusing on Cochise's band, the central Chiricahuas. Cochise was born about 1810, a time of relative peace in northern Mexico when the government supplied rations to the Indians. After the Mexican Revolution (1821), funds were not available, assistance was cut and Apaches started raiding ranches for cattle and horses. By the time Cochise reached maturity, hostilities were widespread. A resourceful and feared warrior, he became the undisputed leader of the Chiricahuas. Trailing Cochise through nearly every skirmish and battle of his career, the narrative is a veritable catalogue of persecution, treachery and cruelty on both sides. In the early 1870s, Cochise accepted peace; he died in 1874.

Yet his life was no steady upward trajectory; it was instead plagued by injuries and debt for the commoner admiral in a royal navy and English society dominated by lineage and property. As Sugden points out, "His life was a mission with the essence of a tour de force, hurrying toward a bloody climax that would change the fate of empires."</p></p><p><b>John Sugden</b> is the author of several biographies, including <i>Nelson: A Dream of Glory</i>, <i>Tecumseh: A Life</i>, and <i>Sir Frances Drake</i>.

In worlds that have fallen--or should have. They wage battles in wars already lost and become heroes--and sometimes martyrs--in their last-ditch efforts to preserve the dignity and individuality of humanity.<br><br>A hack Indian filmmaker takes the pulse of a wounded and declining civilization--21st-century Britain. A pair of swashbuckling Silicon Valley entrepreneurs join forces to make a commercial killing--in organic underground slime and computer-generated jellyfish. A man in a Japanese city takes orders from a talking cat while pursuing a drama of danger and adventure that has become the very essence of his life.<br><br>From "The Littlest Jackal", a darkly hilarious thriller of mercs and gunrunners set in Finland, to a stark vision of a post-atomic netherworld in his haunting tale "Taklamakan", Bruce Sterling once again breaks boundaries, breaks icons, and breaks rules to unleash the most dangerously provocative and intelligent science fiction being written today.</p><p><i>A Good Old-fashioned Future</i> is a paperback collection of seven short stories by former cyberpunk guru turned sociocultural prognosticator Bruce Sterling. Most of the works here come with impressive pedigrees, ranging from a Hugo Award for "Bicycle Repairman" to Hugo nominations for "Maneki Neko" and "Taklamakan." Another piece, "Big Jelly," was cowritten by Sterling's fellow cyberpunk alum, Rudy Rucker.<p> These stories have a lot in common. They all take place in the near future, and most are action-oriented, involving colorful characters such as secret agents, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Mafioso's, and revolutionaries. But they are also personal tales that tend to focus on individuals rather than ideas, which makes them hit home more often than standard SF fare. The best of the bunch is probably "Taklamakan," a high-concept piece about two freelance spies sent to a central Asian desert called Taklamakan, where the Asian Sphere is doing some sort of secret research into space flight. "Bicycle Repairman" is set in the same world, but instead of in an Asian desert it takes place in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the spies in this story aren't the good guys. It's a less successful piece than "Taklamakan" but also a good read.</p><p> Not all of the stories in this collection have the edgy, this-is-what-tomorrow-will-be-like quality that typifies Sterling's best work. But even when Sterling isn't at his best he's entertaining, and <i>A Good Old-Fashioned Future</i> is certainly that. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p>"Science fiction that makes the rest of near-future SF look toylike by comparison.

It was written by Jon Markoff, the <i>Times</i>' ace technology reporter, in classic <i>Times</i> style: cool, factual, authoritative.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the story had the shape and feel of a Hollywood western.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a cyberduel between two archetypical characters, a tale of pursuit and cell phones, of mysterious computer break-ins and complex digital sleuthing.<br><br>It was more than just a great yarn.&nbsp;&nbsp;The story also tapped into rising fears about high-tech crime and computer espionage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade or so, the engine that runs the American economy has gone digital: from Wall Street to Wal-Mart, businesses are relying more and more on computers and electronic networks to track and control daily transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are rushing to set up shop on the Internet, medical records are forwarded over phone lines, corporate computers have become prized information vaults.&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more valuable information goes on-line, the risk that it will be misused or stolen skyrockets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen years ago, a wayward hacker couldn't do much more than inconvenience a few university researchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, he could conceivably shut down an entire country.<br><br>That's the fear, anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the days of the digital desperado riding free and easy on the electronic frontier were about over.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the winter of 1995, cyberspace had become a fairly civilized place: there was digicash and cyberbabes, web star and pet chat, electronic AIDS quilts and digital family trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more, the electronic frontier was starting to look like real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a stubbornly democratic world, to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer networks took the power of the media out of the hands of the few and delivered it into the hands of the many.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it didn't show any signs of altering the human spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;On-line, people had the same desires and emotions, the same social problems and cultural battles.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the same thirst for heroes and villains.<br><br>Kevin and Tsutomu fit the bill nicely.&nbsp;&nbsp;All you had to do was look at the pictures and you could see that Kevin was the bad guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first paragraph of the <i>Times</i> story, he was identified as a "31 year-old computer expert accused of a long crime spree that includes the theft of thousands of data files and at least 20,000 credit card numbers from Computer systems around the nation." (About ten 'paragraphs later, the <i>Times </i>pointed out that there was no evidence Kevin ever profited from those credit card numbers.) Besides having swiped--thousands of megabytes of proprietary software, according to the <i>Times</i>, Kevin had broken into a North American Air Defense (command computer in 1982.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no mention of how he got into this military computer, or what his intentions might have been--was he showing off to friends, or was he trying to launch a missile?--but still, the implication was there.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a dangerous virus in the system, an evil genius who could roam the world via the global Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was arguably the most wanted computer hacker in the world," a United States Attorney in San Francisco was quoted as saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;"He allegedly had access to trade secrets worth millions of dollars. He was a very big threat."<br><br>And Tsutomu, well, he was straight out of central casting.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the San Diego Supercomputer Center, where Tsutomu worked as a computational physicist, the halls were abuzz with speculation about who would play him in the movie. "Maybe Keanu Reeves, if he grew his hair long? Or maybe Tsutomu will insist on an Asian actor," one administrator mused the day after the story appeared. Plopped there in the sleepy pages of the <i>Times</i>, Tsutomu reeked of hipness and heroism.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a wizard's wizard, a mild-mannered scientist who had been living a mild-mannered life in his beach cottage near San Diego until someone was foolish enough to break into his home computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Tsutomu was forced to defend his personal honor and the public good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a period of several weeks, with the help of a pocketful of gizmos and home-brewed hacker-tracking software, Tsutomu accomplished what law enforcement couldn't: he finally put Kevin Mitnick behind bars where he belonged.<br><br>It was a compelling story, one that played off our deepest fears and anxieties about the technological revolution that was unsettling our lives and changing the way we work and live.<br><br>But was it really all so simple?Goodell, a journalist who first wrote about Mitnick for Rolling Stone, here describes how computer hacker Kevin Mitnick was tracked down and finally caught with the help of computer security agent Tsutomu Shimomura. But this is not just a high-speed chase along the information superhighway; it is also the story of how the media hyped the concepts of the hacker and the high tech theft. There is enough accurate technical information to intrigue and educate readers (especially about cellular phones), and Goodell provides a good, clear look at the people, egos, companies and agencies involved in the search for this troubled man. But the mass of details and personalities threatens to overwhelm the book, and the plot plods slowly until the end of the final chase and capture. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tractate Makkos (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>will ship ASAP.</p><p></p><h2>Art of Modern Rock: The Poster Explosion</h2><p>Authoritative, eye-popping, and massive, <i>Art of Modern Rock</i> is the first and last word on contemporary concert posters. An art form that has grown hand-in-hand with the independent music scene, heralding small and large gigs alike, the posters have emerged from visually creative street-level notices to prized collectibles rendered in a variety of styles and media. Today's poster artists combine the expressive freedom pioneered in the poster revolution of the 1960s with the attitude and the do-it-yourself approach of the punk scene, creating an unprecedented surge of innovative poster production on an international scale. Featuring over 1,600 exemplary rock posters and flyers from over 200 international studios and artists, <i>Art of Modern Rock</i> is the long-anticipated sequel to coauthor Paul Grushkin's <i>The Art of Rock</i>. Profiles and quotes from the pioneers in the field and their emerging heirs share nearly 500 gloriously packed pages of poster after mind-blowing poster. As brash and colorful as the burgeoning scene it documents, <i>Art of Modern Rock</i> is the must-have book for music and poster fans and collectors.</p><p>Paul Grushkin is the author of the best-selling The Art of Rock: Posters from Presley to Punk and an acknowledged expert in rock merchandise. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.If MTV is any indication, the face of rock'n'roll needs plastic surgery. Sure, Britney's got a hot belly and Beyonce a glorious booty, but sex is this close to selling itself out. Soon, people will be demanding money shots in their milk commercials. Where's an intelligent consumer to find imagery that both tickles the brain and plugs one into popular culture? <p>Try Paul Grushkin and Dennis King's <i>Art of Modern Rock</i>, which showcases in full color more than 1600 rock posters and flyers by some 200 international artists, from veterans like Frank Kozik to up-and-comers a la Leia Bell. More than a sequel to <i>Art of Rock</i> (Abbeville, 1987) Grushkin's best-selling survey of psychedelic posters from the 1960s and 1970s this is the definitive document of a tens-of-thousands-strong countercultural revolution that began in the late 1980s with the grunge movement and continues today from New York City to San Francisco to...Des Moines and Denton, TX? </p><p>"Wherever there's a 'kid' a teenager, a twentysomething, or even a thirtysomething who is on the cutting edge of music there's someone cranking out posters," Grushkin asserts. </p><p>In fact, more rock posters have been made in the last ten years than in the history of rock'n'roll. To hear Grushkin tell it, this explosion has to do with how today's teenagers access music, i.e., without seeing great LP art, as Grushkin did in his youth, and, increasingly, without walking into a music store. With MP3 looming large, "the art that always defined your relationship to the music" is disappearing. </p><p>In the spirit of the hippies, punks, and alternative rockers before them, young music fans have been filling the void themselves. Via the Internet, these kids track their favorite bands as they tour and call up promoters about doing posters for shows. While some may go digital, many still rely on the old-school (read: cheap) silk-screen method, which King-who holds one of the largest rock poster collections in the world-credits with starting the poster revolution. </p><p>"It's almost political: all these people realizing that they have the power to create and disseminate their own imagery," he says. </p><p>The insane eclecticism of the featured artists called for a thematic organization; readers will witness the many incarnations of that rock poster staple, the devil, for instance. Heightening the effect is King's clever layout, which mimics both a gallery wall and a web site. The final product is a pastel-cum-Day-Glo gem that will make music fans into art fans and vice versa. -<b>Library Journal, Editor's Pick</b> </p><p>Concert posters, as any rockologist will tell you, are the Van Goghs and Matisses of the music scene. And in 1987, author Paul Grushkin cobbled together an encyclopedia of the genre's best in an eight-pound hernia of a book called "The Art of Rock." In the 17 years since, the rise of graphic-art technology, digital music and local indie-rock scenes has sparked a second wave of eye-popping posters. So Grushkin and collector Dennis King teamed up for a sequel. </p><p>"When you've got the Bible," says Grushkin, "there's gotta be a New Testament, right?" Hence, "The Art of Modern Rock": an exhilarating volume of 1,800 posters from grass-roots artists hyping local shows by bands like the Beastie Boys, the Flaming Lips and many more no one's heard of.

Even at the high noon of Europe&#39;s empires China managed to be one of the handful of countries not to succumb. Invaded, humiliated and looted, China nonetheless kept its sovereignty. Robert Bickers&#39; major new book is the first to describe fully what has proved to be one of the modern era&#39;s most important stories: the long, often agonising process by which the Chinese had by the end of the 20th century regained control of their own country. Out of China uses a brilliant array of unusual, strange and vivid sources to recreate a now fantastically remote world: the corrupt, lurid modernity of pre-War Shanghai, the often tiny patches of &#39;extra-territorial&#39; land controlled by European powers (one of which, unnoticed, had mostly toppled into a river), the entrep�ts of Hong Kong and Macao, and the myriad means, through armed threats, technology and legal chicanery, by which China was kept subservient. Today Chinese nationalism stays firmly rooted in memories of its degraded past - the quest for self-sufficiency, a determination both to assert China&#39;s standing in the world and its outstanding territorial claims, and never to be vulnerable to renewed attack. History matters deeply to Beijing&#39;s current rulers - and Out of China explains why.</p><p>Robert Bickers is the author of the highly-acclaimed Empire Made Me and The Scramble for China.

It stresses the importance of man?sdiscovery of truth at the level of realization. Every book has its objective and the objective of the Quran is to make man aware of the Creation plan of God. That is, to tell man why God created this world; what the purpose is of settling man on earth; what is required from man in his pre-death life span, and what he is going to confront after death. Man is born as an eternal creature. When God created man as such, He divided his life span into two periods, the pre-death period, which is a time of trial, and the post-death period, which is the time for receiving the rewards or punishment merited by one?s actions during one?s lifetime. The purpose of the Quran is to make man aware of this reality. This is the theme of this divine Book, which serves to guide man through his entire journey through life into the after-life.</p><p></p><h2>Masters of Art: Velazquez</h2><p>A discussion of the artist&#39;s career and painting technique accompanies reproductions of his portraits, as well as religious and historical paintings</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition (Volume 5)</h2><p>The ultimate authority on the usage and meaning of English words and phrases, unparalleled in its accuracy and comprehensiveness, the Oxford English Dictionary is the supreme reference work for anyone who loves the language.

He seems to have taken a crack at just about every genre: mysteries, noirish thrillers, historicals, locked-room mysteries, adventure novels, spy capers, men&#39;s action, westerns, and, of course, his masterful, long-running Nameless private detective series, now entering its fourth decade, with no signs of creative flagging. He&#39;s also ghosted several Brett Halliday short stories as Michael Shayne for Mike Shayne&#39;s Mystery Magazine, and has managed to collaborate with such fellow writers as John Lutz, Barry Wahlberg, Collin Wilcox and Marcia Muller.

Tour.</p><p>Billy Tipton was a jazz performer who played in clubs throughout the Midwest for nearly 50 years. Tipton never made the big time as a musician and ended up working as a booking agent in Spokane, Washington. Only with Tipton's death in 1989 was it revealed that the five-times-married father to three boys was biologically female. Diane Wood Middlebrook's biography describes the transformation of Dorothy Tipton, a white Oklahoman who was not allowed to play jazz because she was a girl, into Billy Tipton, a male pianist and bandleader. The author traces the life of this itinerant jazz musician over several decades and through changing constructions of gender. <p> Middlebrook, whose biography of Anne Sexton was noted for its controversial use of tape recordings and notes made during the poet's psychiatric treatment, was approached by Kitty Tipton Oakes, one of Billy's former wives, to write this biography; she interviewed his/her friends, spouses, family members, and colleagues and found them to have different, yet universally sympathetic, readings of Tipton's gender. In addition to examining what gender is, <i>Suits Me</i> also asks to whom it belongs: the individual or the people who interact with the individual. <i>--Rebecca Brown</i></p>Dianne Wood Middlebrook is the author of several volumes of poetry and critism as well as the prizewinning bestseller Anne Sexton: A biography. The recipient of many fellowships and awards, she is a professor of English at Stanford University, where she has also served as the director of the center for research on women. She currently lives in San Francisco.</p><h2>Hanna&#39;s Cold Winter (Picture Books)</h2><p>A child tells how her family and other people in Budapest help save the famous hippopotamuses in their city&#39;s zoo from starving one difficult winter during World War II</p><p>A curious true incident is incorporated into a pleasant glimpse of a Budapest family during WW II. Tibor describes Sunday outings, on Papa's day off from the paprika factory, to see the bridge over the Danube or visit the hippopotamuses at the zoo, where they thrive in the natural warm springs. But wartime shortages threaten hippos, even more than people, until Papa suggests feeding them straw, such as that in their own doormat; the hippos then survive the war's coldest winter by eating 9,000 straw hats and slippers contributed by loyal fans. The war is offstage here; what's of interest is the warm period picture of family and city, authentically portrayed in Knutson's adroitly sketched pencil and watercolor art.

Around him the crowded Hong Kong street bustled with activity, illuminated by the countless neon signs that hung from every shopfront and doorway. Diabolus Darkdoom followed him out onto the street, handing a wad of banknotes over to the owner, who had run out after them complaining noisily. He caught up with Nero and sighed, shaking his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be built,&#x201d; Nero said irritably. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show him can&#x2019;t be built.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You did ask his opinion, Max,&#x201d; Darkdoom said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get angry with him just for disagreeing with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s only offended because I completed the design myself,&#x201d; Nero said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Max, you know I have the greatest respect for your abilities,&#x201d; Darkdoom said, &#x201c;but even I have to admit that your finished design seems a touch ambitious and he is the most well-respected architect in the business. There aren&#x2019;t many people who can design and build the sort of building that is required in our line of work and your&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re taking his side now, are you?&#x201d; Nero said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; Darkdoom said, throwing up his hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not getting involved. This is between you and him. If you want to build the new facility for H.I.V.E. in an active volcano then that&#x2019;s exactly what you should do. It&#x2019;s your baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If he&#x2019;d done a slightly better job of hiding the last facility maybe we wouldn&#x2019;t be in this position in the first place,&#x201d; Nero said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe, but it might have been more diplomatic not to actually have said that to him,&#x201d; Darkdoom said with a slightly exasperated-sounding sigh. &#x201c;Then we could have at least finished what was turning out to be an exceptionally good meal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nero raised his hand and hailed one of the city&#x2019;s distinctive red taxis.<br> <br>&#x201c;Although, at least now I do actually know what happens when an immovable object meets an irresistible force,&#x201d; Darkdoom said under his breath as the cab pulled up and Nero climbed inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Airport, please,&#x201d; Nero said to the driver as Darkdoom sat down beside him and slammed the car door shut. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as if I don&#x2019;t have enough to worry about at the moment, Diabolus. Number One&#x2019;s demanding to know why Overlord&#x2019;s behind schedule and Xiu Mei tells me that they&#x2019;re still months away from activation. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how many times I tell him that it&#x2019;s risky to rush the project, he still insists that it&#x2019;s the future of G.L.O.V.E. Meanwhile, I&#x2019;ve got Professor Pike in the other ear telling me that he&#x2019;s working on a similar AI project for the school, but that he&#x2019;s years away from perfecting the behavioral restraints that will make it safe to use and that&#x2019;s why Overlord is too dangerous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Max, you&#x2019;re my oldest friend,&#x201d; Darkdoom said, &#x201c;and I think you&#x2019;re one of the most brilliant men on G.L.O.V.E.&#x2019;s ruling council, but everybody needs a break sometimes, even you. For goodness&#x2019; sake, just take a couple of weeks off and go and lie on a beach somewhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Diabolus,&#x201d; Nero said with a sigh, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to moan. It&#x2019;s just that the temporary facilities we&#x2019;re using at the moment are completely inadequate. I need to at least get construction started on H.I.V.E.&#x2019;s new facility; maybe then I can take a break for a couple of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly, the rear windshield of the taxi exploded in a shower of glass and the driver of the cab slumped forward onto his steering wheel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sniper! Get down!&#x201d; Nero yelled as the taxi swerved, out of control, into oncoming traffic. He took cover behind the seat as more high-velocity rounds buzzed through the air above them. There was a sickening crunch and the taxi spun around as it made glancing contact with another car. The cab bounced across the pavement as pedestrians scattered in all directions and slammed into the plate-glass window of a storefront. Nero and Darkdoom scrambled out of the wrecked car, knowing that they would be sitting ducks if they stayed inside it. They took shelter behind the wall next to the shattered window as the last of the shop&#x2019;s customers ran past the angrily gesticulating shopkeeper and fled through the back door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you hit?&#x201d; Nero asked Darkdoom.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Nero replied, picking up a piece of glass from the floor. &#x201c;Did you see where the shooter was firing from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Darkdoom replied. &#x201c;Shots were on a flat trajectory though. He&#x2019;s got to be somewhere at ground level.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nero held the piece of glass in just the right position to allow him to see a reflection of the chaotic scenes in the street outside the shop. People were running in all directions and the traffic had ground to a halt. There was only one figure that was out of place, somebody dressed in a skintight black outfit and mask who was walking slowly toward the shop with an assault rifle raised to their shoulder. A split second later there was a sudden muzzle flash and the piece of glass in Nero&#x2019;s hand exploded. Nero snarled in pain as shards of glass buried themselves in his hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you armed?&#x201d; Nero asked, through gritted teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Darkdoom replied, pulling a communicator from his inside pocket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call for backup.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t get here in time,&#x201d; Nero said, cursing himself for not bringing a weapon. He had known that the man they were meeting for lunch was no threat to them and so he had let his guard down. He realized now that that might have been a fatal error. &#x201c;We need to move.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nero ran toward the back of the store with Darkdoom just behind him. He burst through the beaded curtain that separated the front of the shop from the storeroom at the rear, just in time to see the shopkeeper running through a door at the far end of the racked shelving that filled the area.<br> <br>&#x201c;This way,&#x201d; Nero said, running toward the door. They ran out into a garbage-strewn alleyway lined with fire escapes and doorways. Nero looked up and down the alley, trying to spot anything that might give them even a slim tactical advantage over whoever it was that was hunting them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here, help me,&#x201d; Nero said, as he closed the shop door behind them and started to push a wheeled dumpster in front of it. He knew it wouldn&#x2019;t stop their pursuer, but it might slow them down. The two men quickly rolled it into position and Nero engaged the brakes on the wheels.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to split up,&#x201d; Nero said after a moment&#x2019;s thought. &#x201c;Give that assassin two separate targets.&#x201d; He pulled his own communicator from his jacket pocket and activated its homing beacon.<br> <br>&#x201c;The backup teams can track us both individually and at least this way one of us will survive if the worst comes to the worst.&#x201d;<br> <br>Darkdoom frowned, but he knew that there was no point arguing with Nero at a time like this. His friend had always been the superior tactician. Even if he didn&#x2019;t much like the sound of this particular idea, he had to admit that it did make strategic sense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Darkdoom said, nodding down the alleyway. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go this way. Don&#x2019;t get yourself killed, Max.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I always try to avoid it,&#x201d; Nero said with a crooked smile. &#x201c;Be careful, we don&#x2019;t know whether we&#x2019;re dealing with a lone hitter or a team yet. There could be more of them out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Darkdoom gave a quick nod and ran off down the alleyway. Nero looked up at the fire escape above him. Heading for the rooftops was risky&#x2014;it would be all too easy to get trapped up there&#x2014;but that risk was outweighed by the advantages that elevation would give him. He ran to the ladder leading to the steel staircase and climbed quickly up it. He was halfway to the roof when he heard a bang from below him and saw the door to the shop being slowly forced open. He made it up two more flights of stairs before the black-clad assassin shoved the door open wide and walked out into the alley. Nero froze, watching as the figure looked down the alleyway in both directions. With luck, Nero thought to himself, the assassin would choose the wrong direction and give Darkdoom more of a head start.<br> <br>A moment later the assassin looked straight up at him, raising his assault rifle. Nero bolted up the remaining stairs, taking them two at a time, sprinting for the roof as bullets pinged off the metal around him. The assassin fired just two short bursts before climbing up onto the fire escape, coming after him. Nero reached the top of the steel staircase and ran onto the roof, looking desperately for the best escape route amongst the numerous air-conditioning vents and skylights that surrounded him. Below him, he could hear the assassin sprinting up the metal stairs; Nero knew he only had seconds.<br> <br>He ran to the far side of the roof and looked down at the four-story drop to the street below. Too far to drop. He heard a noise behind him and turned to see the assassin climbing onto the roof, rifle raised. Whoever they were they had scaled the side of the building in a fraction of the time it had taken Nero. He took a deep breath; he had always known that it might end like this someday, but he wasn&#x2019;t going to give his killer the satisfaction of hearing him beg for his life. The assassin lowered the rifle and then dropped it to the floor, before pulling off the black mask that hid their face. Nero&#x2019;s eyes widened in surprise as the young woman dropped the mask and drew the twin katanas from her back, their silver blades glinting. She could not have been more than sixteen years old, with short black hair, her pale, pretty face betraying no hint of any emotion as she advanced across the rooftop toward him. He had no idea who she was, but there was something hauntingly familiar about her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anastasia Furan sends her regards,&#x201d; the girl said as she approached. &#x201c;She wanted you to know that this is for Elena.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I should have killed Anastasia when I had the chance,&#x201d; Nero said, taking a step backward, feeling a grief that he had long hidden washing over him again at the mention of Elena&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;And now she sends one of her brainwashed children to kill me. I might have known she wouldn&#x2019;t have the guts to face me herself.&#x201d; Nero heard a rumble from the street behind him and glanced over his shoulder as the girl approached, weapons raised.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enough talk,&#x201d; the girl said, her voice calm.<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more,&#x201d; Nero replied. He turned and jumped from the roof, disappearing from view. The girl sprinted to the edge and looked down into the street below. She cursed under her breath in Russian as she saw Nero kneeling on the roof of the red double-decker tram that was trundling away down the street, picking up speed. She turned, sheathed her weapons, and sprinted along the edge of the roof, gaining slowly on the tram. When she reached the end of the roof she vaulted over the low wall and leaped into the air, landing on top of a lamppost with seemingly impossible agility, before springing onto the roof of a passing truck that was only twenty yards or so behind the tram.<br> <br>Nero looked back over his shoulder and saw the girl land on top of the truck like a cat. &#x201c;Impressive,&#x201d; he said under his breath as the girl waited patiently for the truck to close the distance to the tram. Whoever this young woman was, she had obvious talent.<br> <br>He had heard the stories about the abilities of the Furans&#x2019; young killers, but this was the first time he had seen them firsthand. He turned and looked ahead of the tram and saw that they were approaching a set of traffic lights that were just turning red. The truck pulled alongside the tram as it slowed to a halt and the girl vaulted onto the other vehicle. Nero sprang to his feet and charged at the girl, slamming into her hard as she landed. They fell onto the roof, grappling with each other. Nero tried to use the advantage that his extra weight and strength gave him to pin the girl down, but she was just too quick. She delivered a swift blow with the heel of her palm to his chin, his head snapping back, and she squirmed out from underneath him. Nero grabbed desperately at the hilt of one of the swords in the crossed sheaths on her back and pulled it free, rolling away from the girl and struggling to his feet as the girl leaped up and drew the other katana, dropping into a double-handed attacking stance. Nero backed away, holding the blade of his weapon in front of him defensively, trying to ignore the pain from the splinters of glass still embedded in his palm. Now the odds were at least slightly more even, he thought to himself.<br> <br>The girl took three quick strides toward him, her weapon flashing through the air as she advanced. Nero countered the first couple of blows, astonished by the speed and ferocity of the young girl&#x2019;s attack. He knew how to fight with a blade, but all that meant was he knew almost instantly that he was hopelessly outmatched. The girl&#x2019;s blade was like an extension of her body, moving too fast to follow, let alone counter. The tip of her sword scythed across his chest, leaving a deep bloody cut and Nero staggered backward. The girl drew back the sword and struck, the tip of the blade spearing deep into Nero&#x2019;s thigh and he gave a pained gasp as he felt his leg give way beneath him. He fell to one knee as the girl raised the katana high above her head ready to deal a killing blow.<br> <br>The traffic lights turned green.<br> <br>The tram lurched forward and for an instant the girl was caught off balance. Nero desperately swept his own blade upward, catching her off guard and leaving a long, deep gash in her cheek. The girl stepped backward, her left hand instinctively flying up to her face as the savage wound began bleeding profusely. Nero flung his sword to one side and threw himself forward with a grunt, trying to ignore the searing pain in his thigh, and tackled the girl, wrapping his arms around her waist. The pair of them flew off the top of the tram, dropping several yards before slamming down on to the roof of a car below. The katana flew from the girl&#x2019;s hand and clattered into the road, the impact stunning her and knocking the air from her lungs. Nero rolled off her and dropped to the ground with a pained gasp. He picked up the girl&#x2019;s fallen sword and turned back to her just as she rolled off the car&#x2019;s roof. He raised the sword quickly, pressing its tip to her throat, sending a drop of blood trickling down her neck. He saw her tense, ready to strike.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Nero said. &#x201c;You may be fast, my dear, but nobody&#x2019;s that fast.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl glared back at him, half her face covered in blood, her eyes narrowing.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have no idea how fast I am,&#x201d; the girl said. Nero barely even saw her move as her stiffened knuckles struck his wrist, the sword dropping from his numb fingers and into her other hand. She spun the sword, bringing it to Nero&#x2019;s throat as he took a step backward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Time to die.&#x201d;<br> <br>The single shot rang out and the girl slammed back into the ruined car, sliding to the ground with a startled expression on her face. Darkdoom stepped out from behind a nearby van and lowered the assault rifle that she had abandoned just a few minutes earlier on the rooftop, its muzzle still smoking.<br> <br>&#x201c;I had second thoughts about the whole splitting-up thing,&#x201d; Darkdoom said, &#x201c;fortunately for you. The backup chopper&#x2019;s two minutes out. Are you okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nero gave a nod and kicked the sword away from the girl&#x2019;s hand before kneeling down beside her and feeling for a pulse in her neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell the backup team that we have an urgent med-evac,&#x201d; Nero said, applying pressure to the wound in the girl&#x2019;s chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you joking?&#x201d; Darkdoom said as he began to hear the first wails of police sirens in the distance. &#x201c;She very ...</p><h2>Man Ray : Paris Photographs, 1920-34</h2><p>As I recall discovering this book of photographs, I remember the sense of beauty and mystery that remains undiminished almost seventy years after its original publication. On a formal plane, one can easily understand how Man Ray manipulated the optics of the camera, juxtaposing near and far, object against object, space against object, and tactile against transparent. It is also apparent how he deliberately manipulated the process of photographic printmaking, using unusual tones of black, white, and gray to transform content into spaces, forms and surfaces. However, it is not simply how Man Ray manipulated the technical processes that is significant. What is important is how the images function visually, and how the photograph bridges or breaks the gap between what is perceived and/or imagined.</p><p></p><h2>Lido: the Feel-Good Debut of the Year</h2><p><p><b>'THE LIDO is a joyous and uplifting debut - a testament to kindness and friendship and all those values society must hold dear' SARAH WINMAN, author of When God Was a Rabbit and Tin Man</b></p><p><b>Meet Rosemary, 86, and Kate, 26: dreamers, campaigners, outdoor swimmers...</b></p><p>Rosemary has lived in Brixton all her life.

The entrepreneurs that Thiel and Levchin recruited to overhaul world currency markets first had to face one of the greatest series of trials ever thrown at a Silicon Valley company before becoming part of Internet lore. </p><p>Jackson's lively, blow-by-blow account of PayPal's death-defying beginnings and ferocious battles offers a detailed perspective that only an insider could provide. Read The PayPal Wars and you'll learn how: </p><p>� EBay unleashed a no-holds-barred effort to dislodge an unwelcome PayPal from its site. </p><p>� Organized crime attempted to ransack PayPal&#x2014;but the company fought back. </p><p>� Turmoil pushed PayPal to the brink of insolvency before it turned its business around. </p><p>Faced with these daunting challenges, PayPal survived thanks to a unique corporate culture that empowered its talented employees to push the envelope. But an entrepreneurial environment and gifted people weren't enough to ward off every threat. "Our clashes with the credit card associations, the banking lobby, state regulators, foreign Mafioso, and litigation-happy lawyers significantly increased after our IPO," writes Jackson, adding that the public offering that was meant to strengthen PayPal with an infusion of cash ironically attracted a rogue's gallery of foes instead. </p><p>"The modern business environment," Jackson concludes, "turned out to be more hostile than even our fiercest competitor." This somber warning&#x2014;that regulators, lawyers, and lobbyists threaten to undermine American entrepreneurship&#x2014;makes The PayPal Wars a timely read for every businessman, investor, and concerned citizen.</p></p><h2>62 Projects to Make with a Dead Computer: (And Other Discarded Electronics)</h2><p>Computer hacking takes on a whole new meaning when you're going at it with a screwdriver and hammer: announcing the most wildly inventive, eco-friendly craft book on repurposing everyday objects since <i>Generation T</i>.

In this history of liberalism since the 1930s, a distinguished historian offers an eloquent account of postwar liberalism, where it came from, where it has gone, and why. The book supplies a crucial chapter in the history of twentieth-century American politics as well as a valuable and clear perspective on the state of our nation's politics today. </p><p> <i>Liberalism and Its Discontents</i> moves from a penetrating interpretation of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal to an analysis of the profound and frequently corrosive economic, social, and cultural changes that have undermined the liberal tradition. The book moves beyond an examination of the internal weaknesses of liberalism and the broad social and economic forces it faced to consider the role of alternative political traditions in liberalism's downfall. What emerges is a picture of a dominant political tradition far less uniform and stable--and far more complex and contested--than has been argued. The author offers as well a masterly assessment of how some of the leading historians of the postwar era explained (or failed to explain) liberalism and other political ideologies in the last half-century. He also makes clear how historical interpretation was itself a reflection of liberal assumptions that began to collapse more quickly and completely than almost any scholar could have imagined a generation ago. As both political history and a critique of that history, <i>Liberalism and Its Discontents</i>, based on extraordinary essays written over the last decade, leads to a new understanding of the shaping of modern America. </p></p><p>Noted historian, professor at Columbia University, and winner of the American Book Award for History, Alan Brinkley has collected 17 essays written over the past two decades for <i>Liberalism and Its Discontents</i>. The assembled essays constitute a very informed, well-written, and engaging look at major issues in 20th-century American history. Beginning with Roosevelt and the New Deal, Brinkley is able to focus on major characters and trends while also exploring some very interesting side roads. Along with essays on major themes (such as the New Deal or the legacy of World War II), he brings his considerable insight and writing ability to an analysis of modern political conventions and to profiles of characters as diverse as Allard Lowenstein and Oral Roberts. Written in a lucid and entertaining style, this is serious history that is a pleasure to read. <i>--Robert McNamara</i><b>Alan Brinkley</b> is Professor of History at Columbia University. His many books include <i>Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin, and the Great Depression</i>, winner of the American Book Award for History, and <i>The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War</i>.</p><h2>Wild Western Days: The Coming of Cassidy, Bar-20, Hopalong Cassidy</h2><p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The outfit of the Bar-20 was, perhaps, the most famous of all from Canada to the Rio Grande. The foreman, Buck Peters, controlled a crowd of men (who had all the instincts of boys) that had shown no quarter to rustlers, and who, while always carefree and easygoing (even fighting with great good humor and carelessness), had established the reputation of being the most reckless gang of daredevil gunfighters that ever pounded leather.&#x201d; (from <i>Bar-20</i>)</p><p>Included in this big omnibus are three long novels, <i>Bar-20</i>, <i>Hopalong Cassidy</i>, and <i>The Coming of Cassidy</i>. These are Clarence Mulford&#x2019;s first three Cassidy novels, stories that helped to establish the genre conventions of the Western in the first decade of the twentieth century, and which introduced the famous character, Hopalong Cassidy. Cassidy, was of course, the hero of many films, and a classic, long-running network television show, starring silver-haired William Boyd and his horse, Topper.</p><br><br></p><p><br><p>Clarence E. Mulford is the creator of the character Hopalong Cassidy, who appeared in sixty-six films, twenty-eight novels, and a long-running television series. Mulford died in 1956.</p><br><br>"The Mulford stories about Cassidy are rousing adventures, with some of the best action sequences in early Western fiction."<br><br>---Bill Pronzini, editor of <i>Wild Westerns<br><br></i>"The stories teem with wildly exciting events. . . .&nbsp; They are among the best of their kind."<br><i>--The New York Times</i> on <i>The Coming of Cassidy<br><br></i>&#x201c;Hopalong Cassidy, introduced in a 1907 novel by the Illinois-born writer Clarence E . Mulford, is as durable a Western hero as Max Brand&#x2019;s Destry or Owen Wister&#x2019;s Virginian. Mulford&#x2019;s Hoppy, a profane cowboy with a limp (thus &#x201c;Hop-a-Long&#x201d;), was a far cry from the black-clad, cleaned-up, soft-spoken, character portrayed by William Boyd in over sixty movies, but Boyd&#x2019;s Hoppy is the one best remembered today. This omnibus collection of three of the original Mulford novels should win a new and appreciative audience for these grand Western stories.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dale L.

Along the way, she meets a wicked wolf who tricks her into thinking he's her granny. Sumptuous illustrations, inspired by the golden age of Dutch painting in the 17th century and Renaissance, capture the charm and spirit of a tale that has remained steadfast in oral and written versions throughout the centuries. An Author's note about the tale's history is included.<br></p></p><p>Gennady Spirin was classically educated at the Moscow Art School at the Academy of Arts and at the Moscow Stroganov Institute. Influenced by Russian Renaissance painters, Mr. Spirin has developed his own unique style of illustration using traditional Russian art techniques. His work appeared four times on the annual New York Times Ten Best Illustrated Books of the Year list. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.Gr 2-4&#x2013;This classic Grimm tale has had many interpretations over the years, but Spirin's splendid version is inspired by the lavish Dutch paintings of the 17th century. The jacket, with windmills and Renaissance cathedral spires in the background, sets the scene and centers the heroine in a colorful outfit carrying a bountiful bouquet of flowers and wearing a white brimmed, vibrant red peaked hat tied snuggly under her chin. Grandmother, who is garbed in lace and flounces, and the hunters with their long rifles and Cavalier hats fit well into the setting. The wolf, when he appears, fills the page: he is large and ferocious, and dressed in an elaborate ruffled tunic, braided, wide-cuffed pants, and a broad-brimmed feathered hat. He's the Renaissance man personified, although his slathering tongue betrays his debonair look. Spirin places his characters up front on the page against plentiful white space, giving intensity to the unfolding drama. A simply retold and richly illustrated addition.<i>Barbara Elleman, Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, Amherst, MA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Gaines was an Air Force veteran and had been piloting choppers for twenty-five years. He liked to keep his passengers happy. </p><p> Flicking a twist of her curly, honey-colored hair from her face, Anneka Marram craned to get a better view from the chopper's open observation window. </p><p> From their vantage point a hundred yards up, she could see the large crack that zigzagged down the concrete wall of the dam. Jets of water spurted through in a half dozen places, each one blasting a spray of fine debris out into the air with it. Surely it couldn't hold much longer. Two billion cubic yards of water were putting that crack under intolerable stress. </p><p> Anneka shook her head slightly, as if unwilling to entertain the thought of what might happen next. She leaned across the chopper's cramped cabin and touched Les Dowd, her cameraman, on the shoulder. He nodded without looking and started to pan his lens across the top of the dam. </p><p> Countless police cars and fire engines were parked at each end, looking like little more than toys from this height. Human figures stood in clusters close to the vehicles, monitoring the water that poured more forcibly from the dam's damaged area with every passing minute. </p><p> The mayor was at the scene, taking personal charge of the emergency. Commissioner James Gordon of the GCPD was on hand as well. There was little they could do but wait. All staff had already been evacuated. The relief sluices had been opened, carrying roaring torrents of water away from the eight-mile long lake that had been formed when the dam first closed off this stretch of the Gotham River. </p><p> But everyone who stood there -- police officers, public officials, dam and hydroelectric personnel -- all knew that it was futile. It might take an hour, it might be only a minute -- but the dam was going to burst. </p><p> Dowd slowly raked his lens down the face of the massive concrete structure. On her monitor, Anneka saw the picture shift to follow the course of what had once been the mighty Gotham River. Its raging waters had flowed here for millennia, carving out a steep-sided gorge that was fifty feet deep and double that across. Now the river was little more than a stream meandering away from the dam, dwarfed by the bluffs on either side. </p><p> A quarter-mile downstream Anneka could see the hydroelectric station. A dozen figures straggled away from it, making for the high ground above the steep banks, abandoning the installation completely. </p><p> Anneka lifted her microphone closer to her lips to blot out the steady thrum of the rotors and began to speak: "The generating station is in the process of being evacuated now, and I'm informed by dam management that all personnel have been accounted for." </p><p> She paused as her monitor showed Dowd's camera panning down the valley toward distant Gotham City. "An estimated twenty thousand people live between the dam and the city. And although the authorities are doing their best to evacuate those at risk, there are serious fears that there are just too many people, and not enough time." </p><p> Pausing again, Anneka twisted her head to look back at the dam through the opposite window. The sun was starting to sink, casting a purple autumn glow over the wooded hills. But there was light enough for Anneka to see that the main crack had doubled in size, and several new, smaller ones in a spiderweb network were already gushing water. </p><p> A never-ending flood would wash away dozens of farms and thousands of acres of fertile soil as it swept down to the ocean. Anneka shuddered to think what would happen when that wall of water and mud roared into Gotham City itself. </p><p> <i>It's only a question of time,</i> she thought, and, perversely, a surge of excitement coursed through her. She'd been junior reporter on the GCTV chopper for almost six years now, spending her life describing traffic jams and highway accidents. They'd been on their way to a three-vehicle pileup on the interstate this afternoon when the emergency call came in about the dam. Now she was reporting <i>real</i> news. And the station would be relaying her report not just across the state, but to the whole country. She'd be seen by a hundred million viewers. A billion, if it went global. </p><p> It might be a black day for Gotham City, but Anneka's career was going to skyrocket. </p><p> Anneka switched her mike off. "How does this sound, Les?" she asked the lensman. "We go down, hover in front of the dam for some close-up shots of those water jets. Then back up to five hundred feet, wait for the final collapse...and follow the wall of water all the way down the valley till it hits the city." </p><p> "Good thinking." The lanky cameraman nodded. Straight out of journalism school, he'd been with the station only a few months. But if they caught this on film, it would be Hollywood calling. "We better move it, though. Be dark in another half hour." </p><p> "Can we do it, Chuck?" Anneka called to the gruff, middle-aged pilot. </p><p> He shrugged his shoulders without turning to look at her. "Strap in tight," he rasped, his voice hoarse from a lifetime of cigarette smoking. "We're goin' for the money shot!" </p><p> Chuck hit the controls and the chopper banked steeply, turning back toward the dam, dropping as it approached. Fifty feet from the valley floor, just level with the top of the banks, Chuck leveled out, hovering directly in front of the massive, cracking wall. </p><p> Les's camera raked up the face of the dam, visible only through the thick curtain of water cascading from above. </p><p> Anneka felt another frisson of fear. Gazing up at the rends in the dam, she could almost feel the relentless pressure of countless tons of water that was fighting to escape its confinement. </p><p> She switched her mike back on. "From above," she began, "the debris that the torrents are tearing free looked small and insignificant. From this vantage point, however, we can see chunks of concrete the size of cars! I'm no engineer, but I really don't see any way the dam can hold much longer." </p><p> Somewhere above them the water tore a new hole in the dam face, sending out a gusher that reached almost to the hovering chopper before it fell away. Lumps of concrete and infill clattered off the fuselage. </p><p> "Goin' up," Chuck Gaines mouthed, pointing upward with one forefinger. Twenty-five years as a pilot had thrown him into a whole host of dangerous situations, from blizzards to ice storms to rescues at sea. A bursting dam was a new one for him -- and not one he chose to stay close to for too long. The helicopter started to rise. </p><p> Fifty feet above, a section of dam the size of an SUV erupted under the force of the water behind. A fountain of broiling, muddy water shot out with all the power of a huge geyser. Almost instantly, the chopper was assailed by cascading water and concrete blocks. It pitched wildly from side to side as Chuck Gaines struggled for control, throwing Anneka and Les violently around the interior. </p><p> The cameraman's head hit an area of unpadded airframe, and he blanked out immediately. Anneka screamed, clinging onto her safety strap so tightly her knuckles were white. </p><p> "I can't hold her!" Chuck cried out, his voice barely audible over the chaos of the water. "Hang on! I'll try -- " </p><p> He never finished the sentence. A rain of concrete chunks thudded into them from above. The windshield shattered, and there was a loud metallic shriek as one of the rotors snapped under the bombardment. The chopper pitched forward and started to plunge toward the growing maelstrom below. </p><p> Buffeted by the water pouring in, hardly able to breathe, Anneka Marram struggled in vain to undo the catch on the chopper door. The acrid smell of shorting electrical wiring stung her nostrils. Silently, she kissed her big break farewell. A hundred million people might well see her on the evening news that night, but it would be as a statistic on a long list of fatalities. </p><p> Abruptly, her panic ebbed away, and a strange sense of calm suffused her. Almost matter-of-factly, she contemplated her impending death. </p><p> But what, she wondered, was that red and blue blur streaking through the air?<br> </p><p> Powering through the skies at more than a hundred miles an hour, Superman saw a flash as the setting sun reflected off the helicopter's fuselage. Instantly, his telescopic vision zoomed in on the plunging craft, revealing the three people inside. </p><p> Shifting the direction of his flight, he increased his speed until he was bulleting down toward the foot of the dam face. A two-hundred-pound concrete block struck him on the back, the debris splintering as it ricocheted off his near-invulnerable body. </p><p> At the last second Superman checked his forward motion, angling his body upward so he was directly under the tumbling helicopter. Ignoring the water and rubble that poured down around him, he reached up with both hands and braced himself to take the doomed chopper's weight. </p><p> <i>Superman has the helicopter.</i> J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter, watched from the riverbank as he relayed the telepathic message directly to the minds of the other Justice League members who were present. Telepathy was part of his Martian birthright, and now Manhunter used his amazing mental ability to coordinate and keep the team in touch while in action. <i>He's carrying it to safety now.</i> </p><p> The Justice League -- the elite team of the Earth's mightiest super heroes -- had been formed with the protection of the planet in mind. They sprang into action like a well-oiled machine whenever any disaster or superhuman villain was too much for one hero to handle alone. </p><p> Six of them had been in the Watchtower, their lunar headquarters, when the crisis broke. A message from the mysterious Oracle, who ran their vast computer network from her HQ in Gotham City, had filled their monitor screens. They hadn't needed Batman, Gotham's grim guardian, to urge them to teleport to the scene at once. </p><p> Now, perched atop a rocky crag overlooking the entire dam front, silhouetted against the September sky like some twilight demon, Batman took control. </p><p> He didn't particularly like using the telepathic link Manhunter established between the team members. A lifelong loner, Batman preferred to act with only one voice in his head: his own. But even he had to admit that the facility often came in useful. </p><p> <i>Complete collapse could come at any second. Green Lantern, use your power ring to keep the dam standing.</i> The thoughts blasted from Batman's mind with the speed and accuracy of bullets. <i>Manhunter, get those people on the dam edge to safety. Flash, go down the valley. Use your superspeed and warn everyone you can.</i> </p><p> Flash and Manhunter didn't pause to speak. One took to the air, the other started running, and both veered away to accomplish their tasks. </p><p> Protected by the force field generated by his power ring, Green Lantern hovered before the dam. With every second that passed, more of the concrete was disintegrating, allowing a deluge of water to escape. Lantern's right arm extended, the ring on his middle finger suddenly flaring bright green as he focused his willpower through it. </p><p> Instantaneously, a thin green beam emanated from the center of the ring, widening dramatically as it traveled toward the collapsing dam. It grew until it covered the entire dam face, shutting off the water spouts, holding back the collapsing concrete like a wall of shimmering, impenetrable green energy. </p><p> Green Lantern smiled wryly to himself. The ring had been the gift of an alien, the very last Guardian of the Universe. Kyle Rayner had never wanted to be a hero, never expected to be one -- and would have run a mile if anyone had told him otherwise. But now he was a hero -- and not just any hero, either. He was the Emerald Warrior, one of the most powerful super heroes of them all. The ring acted directly to achieve anything he willed. Kyle was sure it must have limitations, but he hadn't discovered them yet. </p><p> <i>Gotta admit,</i> Lantern thought, taking care to keep the sentiment to himself, <i>it's a kick I wouldn't change for the world.</i> </p><p> Superman deposited the chopper up on the lakeside, well away from the dam, staying only long enough to check that the occupants were safe before flying back to join his companions. <i>Wonder Woman and I will go in behind the energy wall.</i> His thoughts came through loud and clear to all of them. <i>We'll use high-speed friction and my heat vision to fuse the dam face.</i> </p><p> <i>No!</i> Batman's thought stabbed almost painfully into their minds. <i>We can't save the dam. Use your speed and strength to gouge out a channel deep enough to take the water all the way to Gotham harbor.</i> </p><p> <i>Are you sure that's best?</i> Superman queried. </p><p> <i>Positive,</i> Batman thought curtly. <i>Whatever we do, that dam is coming down -- and time is running out.</i> </p><p> Batman blanked off his mind, shutting out any further protest Superman might make. </p><p> Of all the dozens of members of the Justice League, from the underwater monarch Aquaman to the mighty Steel, Batman was the least natural team player. His years of service as Gotham City's Dark Knight had turned him into the perfect lone hero. But often, in a team situation, he came across as arrogant and high-handed -- especially when he insisted things be done exactly as he wanted, not caring if it rubbed his teammates the wrong way. </p><p> J'onn J'onzz glided down to join Batman on his crag, the red and green of the Martian's costume glinting in the fading sunlight. The whole dam had been cleared; Jim Gordon and the others now stood a good hundred yards back from any danger. </p><p> The two heroes watched in silence as Wonder Woman and Superman began their colossal task. Operating at superspeed, their movement so fast it was only a blur, they ripped into the valley bottom below the dam with their bare hands. Both possessed superstrength and invulnerability; their hands were superior to any tool. </p><p> Within seconds, the first fifty yards of a wide channel, thirty feet deep, had been scoured out, leaving massive piles of infill on the channel sides.

Most are unaware that this most popular American sport was created by the teams that now make up the Ivy League. From the day Princeton played the first intercollegiate game in 1869, these major schools of the northeast&#x2014;Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Yale&#x2014;shaped football as we now know it. Almost every facet of the game still bears their imprint: they created the All-America team, produced the first coaches, devised the basic rules, invented many of the strategies, developed much of the equipment, and even named the positions. Both the Heisman and Outland trophies are named for Ivy League players.</p><p>Crowds of 80,000 no longer attend Ivy League games as they did seventy years ago, and Ivy teams are not the powerhouses they once were, but at times they can still be a step ahead of the rest of football, as in 1973 when Brown and Penn started the first black quarterbacks to face each other in major college history.</p><p>In this rich history, Bernstein shows that much of the culture that surrounds American football, both good and bad, has its roots in the Ivy League. The college fight song is an Ivy League creation (Yale's was written by Cole Porter), as are the marching bands that play them. With their long winning streaks and impressive victories, Ivy teams started a national obsession with football in the first decades of the twentieth century that remains alive today. But football was almost abolished early on because of violence in Ivy games, and it took President Theodore Roosevelt to mediate disagreements about rough play in order for football to remain a college sport. Gambling and ticket scalping were as commonplace then as now, as well as payoffs and recruiting abuses, fueled by the tremendous amount of money generated by the games, revenue that was oftentimes greater than that collected by the rest of the university. But the Ivy teams confronted those abuses, and in so doing helped develop our ideals about the role of athletics in college life. Although Ivy League football and its ancient rivalries have disappeared from big-time sports by their own accord, their legacy remains with every snap of the ball.</p></p><p>Mark F. Bernstein, a graduate of Princeton University, is a freelance journalist, cartoonist, and lawyer living in Philadelphia. He has written for the Wall Street Journal, New Republic, and other magazines and newspapers.<p>Chapter One<br>The Big Three</p><p>As America is the daughter of Europe, President John F. Kennedy once joked to open a commencement address in New Haven, Connecticut, so he was pleased to be at Yale, the daughter of Harvard. Kennedy a member of the Harvard class of 1940 and a former scrub on the freshman football team, was in friendly territory and his wry remark was greeted with smiles by the Elis assembled. Yet it contained a kernel of truth. Not only Harvard and Yale, but indeed all eight colleges that comprise the Ivy League share a filial, or at least a fraternal, bond.</p><p>Harvard, of course, came first. The oldest college in North America was founded in 1636 with a bequest by John Harvard, a Calvinist minister. Protective of their position even in infancy, the Harvard authorities tried to squelch the establishment of a rival college in Connecticut a few years later, arguing that "the whole population of New England was scarcely sufficient to support one institution of this nature, and the establishment of a second would, in the end, be a sacrifice of both." Nevertheless, in 1701 a group of Harvard-trained Congregationalists founded a college in New Haven, which they soon renamed in honor of Elihu Yale, a prominent Welsh benefactor who never set foot on the campus.</p><p>Long before the Ivy schools battled over football, they squabbled over God, adding a dimension of competition to that of kinship. As leaders of the educational and religious establishment, Harvard and Yale resisted the Great Awakening, prompting many of their dissenting alumni to found new colleges that would restore orthodoxy. The College of New Jersey was founded by Yale and Harvard graduates in 1746 to train Presbyterian ministers and shortly thereafter moved to the town of Princeton. Alumni of the three colleges continued to spread their influence throughout the colonies. In 1770, Eleazer Wheelock, another Yale alumnus, relocated his Indian Charity School from Connecticut to the North Woods of New Hampshire and renamed it after the Earl of Dartmouth. Rhode Island College, founded by Baptists with a Princeton minister as its first president, was renamed Brown University in 1804 to honor Nicholas Brown, a wealthy alumnus.</p><p>Ivy schools outside the orbit of Calvinism also arose amid the intellectual tumult of the eighteenth century. King's College in New York City, which was named for King George II, was founded in 1754 and renamed Columbia after the Revolution. Benjamin Franklin founded the Charity School in Philadelphia in 1740, which went through several identities before becoming the University of Pennsylvania in 1779. Cornell, the only member of the Ivy League not founded before the Revolution, was a private land-grant college chartered in 1865 and named in honor of Ezra Cornell, a prominent benefactor who had made his fortune in Western Union telegraph bonds. It is a peculiar hybrid, a private college that nonetheless has some departments subsidized by the State of New York.</p><p>Owing in part to this background, the first eastern colleges shared similar views on the proper role of physical training. They regarded it as decadent to the extent, that is, that they regarded it at all. Their concern was with improving minds and souls, not bodies.</p><p>The situation at Princeton is illustrative. Professors, most of whom were clergymen, were strict taskmasters who frowned on the frivolity of games. Students took almost no exercise save walking or horseback riding and their diet was, by modern standards, terrible. What early games they did play were unorganized and certainly unsanctioned by the college administration&#x2014;perhaps a quick footrace or a game of quoits. As late as 1846, one student could note that "The old puerility of playing marbles is again arrived on the campus."</p><p>With a mixture of priggishness and quack science, the faculty denounced outdoor diversions as "low and unbecoming gentlemen and students" and "attended with great danger to the health by sudden and alternate heats and colds." Even sleigh riding was forbidden. As might be expected, relations between professors and students, already strained thanks to the narrow, monotonous curriculum, occasionally spilled into outright rebellion. When the Princeton faculty disciplined several undergraduates in 1807, their classmates rioted, forcing the administration to suspend classes for several days. Bored and overworked, students of this era wasted their free time lounging around, smoking, and drinking. Brawls and even duels were not uncommon.</p><p>Athletics was one of several outlets students began to find for their energies in the first half of the nineteenth century. Perhaps because it provided a shared social experience combined with the familiar thrill of the brawl, football proved especially attractive. American football has its origins in soccer, a game that dates back to antiquity, when Greeks played a game called "harpaston," in which the object was to kick or carry a ball across the end line of a marked field. The Romans introduced soccer to England, where games became so raucous that in 1349 King Edward II banned it on pain of imprisonment. Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, and later Charles II issued similar bans, which proved equally ineffective. Shakespeare mentioned the game and its roughness in A Comedy of Errors and in King Lear. The Pilgrims are thought to have brought soccer to the New World, and may have played it on the first Thanksgiving, thus anticipating one of the great American traditions.</p><p>By the 1820s, Princeton students are reported to have been playing a form of football game called "balldown" on a field next to Nassau Hall, dividing themselves into teams according to the first letter of a student's last name. All the Ivy colleges share some version of this story. Harvard students played an annual game that came to be known as "Bloody Monday" as early as 1827 (Winslow Homer captured it a generation later in one of his earliest drawings) and something of its style can be guessed from the name. Columbia claims football antecedents dating from 1824, while Penn students were playing local high school teams as far back as the 1840s. Yale also started an annual freshman-sophomore "rush" in the 1840s, a kind of mass hazing ritual that soon grew into an event of great formality, with exploits commemorated in songs and poetry:</p><p>There were yellings and shoutings and<br>wiping of noses,<br>Where the hue of the lily was changed to<br>the rose's,<br>There were tearing of shirts, and ripping<br>of stitches,<br>and breaches of peaces, and pieces<br>of britches</p><p>Yale students had to abandon the rushes in 1858, however, when the city of New Haven refused to let them use the town green. When they tried to move the game elsewhere, the faculty, which had long taken a dim view of all this foolishness, banned it outright. Harvard outlawed Bloody Monday in 1860, while the Brown faculty halted its annual freshman-sophomore game two years later, only to reinstate it in 1866.</p><p>Rowing, however, was the first intercollegiate sport, and many of the rivalries that today characterize the Ivy League, not to mention many of the ills that still plague intercollegiate athletics in general, had their origins on the water rather than the gridiron. In the 1840s, while football players were still slugging each other on campus greens, both Harvard and Yale organized their first crews. When the two met on New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee in 1852, in the nation's first intercollegiate athletic contest, their expenses were paid as part of a railroad promotion to lure tourists to the White Mountains. Intercollegiate match races proved so popular with spectators (including gamblers) that they were moved to Saratoga, the fashionable New York summer resort and horse racing capital that was something like the Las Vegas of its day. Within a few years, Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Princeton crews were also competing in what came to be known as the Rowing Association of American Colleges. Unable to dominate the sport any longer, Harvard and Yale withdrew from the association in 1875, vowing henceforth to row only against each other. Others tried unsuccessfully to continue the regattas, but learned an early lesson in how important affiliation with the Big Two could be. It was with this background, then, and among the broadening associations among these colleges, that intercollegiate football followed.</p><p>Sports and entertainment of all sorts received a boost at the end of the Civil War when, as it would after both world wars in the next century, the nation indulged itself in the pursuit of money and recreation. College campuses swelled with returning veterans, many of whom brought with them a love of vigorous games and impatience with college prohibitions against them. In the fall of 1869, a group of Rutgers students issued an invitation to Princeton to meet them in a series of three football games&#x2014;an attempt, so the story goes, to avenge Princeton's 40-2 routing of Rutgers in baseball three years earlier.</p><p>Rutgers' challenge was received by William S. Gummere, captain of Princeton's baseball team, who is better known to history for his contributions on the diamond as the inventor of the hook-slide, and in the courtroom as chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. Gummere corresponded with his counterpart to agree on a set of rules for the contest. The field was to be 360 feet long and 225 feet wide. The object was to drive the ball between two goal posts eight paces apart (with no crossbar) by kicking it or batting it in the air. Throwing the ball or running with it was forbidden, though players were allowed to catch it. There were to be twenty-five men to a side, as well as four judges and two referees. Tripping and holding were the only fouls.</p><p>Saturday, November 6, 1869, was fixed as the date for the contest, because there were no classes on Saturday afternoons and students would have been forbidden to play on the Sabbath. At nine o'clock on the morning of that first game, a "jerky little train . . . crowded to the aisles and platforms with a freight of eager students" chugged out of the Princeton depot for New Brunswick. The Rutgers students met them at the station and showed their guests the sights of the town (including the local billiards parlor) before lunch.</p><p>Admission was free to the more than one hundred spectators who seated themselves on the ground or perched atop a fence that partially enclosed the field. Although the game had few of the trappings of college football games even a few years later, one thing the Princeton partisans did bring with them was their famous "rocket" cheer, which hissed like an exploding rocket: "Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Tiger sis-boom-ah, Princeton!" By the 1890s, the rocket cheer would develop into Princeton's famous "locomotive" the cadence of which imitates the sound of a train engine gathering speed and is still heard at football games today.</p><p>None of the players in that first game wore uniforms, although the Rutgers students did sport scarlet "turbans," which one imagines resembled the modern "do-rag." The Princetonians simply stripped off their coats, vests, and hats, rolled up their sleeves, and prepared to play. For the most part they were not big men, even by the standards of their time; one historian has estimated that they averaged only about five-foot-eight in height and weighed perhaps 150 pounds.</p><p>One tradition that was present from the very beginning was the pregame coin toss, but this time there were two of them; one to determine who would kick to whom and a second to determine who would defend which goal. Rutgers won the first toss and elected to receive. Shortly after three o'clock, Princeton kicked off from a tee made of piled up dirt, and intercollegiate football was under way.</p><p>Princeton had something to learn about tactics, for it chose to kick off into the wind and shanked the ball to one side. This enabled Rutgers to take over in excellent field position, from where it began dribbling toward Princeton's goal. Both teams appear to have played a crude zone defense, posting a few men to guard the goal and assigning everyone else to cover certain parts of the field rather than a specific man on the other team. By carefully shielding the man with the ball, Rutgers was able to score first, about five minutes into the game.</p><p>Finesse became intercollegiate football's first casualty. Gummere decided to change tactics and instructed one of his teammates, a behemoth named Jacob Michael, known as "Big Mike," to break up the Rutgers cocoon. This he did and "scattered the players like a bursting bundle of sticks." Soon afterward, Princeton tied the score on a long kick. From there, the game turned into a siege. At one point Big Mike and a Rutgers player made for the ball at the same time and crashed through the fence, toppling spectators.</p><p>The game was to be played until someone scored six goals. Noticing that the taller Princeton men were able to bat down high kicks, the Rutgers captain ordered his men to keep their passes short and low to the ground. This was made difficult owing to the quality of the ball, which kept getting deflated. The adjustment to crisp passing worked, though, and Rutgers scored the last two goals to win, 6-4, in just over three hours.</p><p>A week later, Rutgers journeyed to Princeton for the second game of the series. This time Gummere tried a new strategy of short kicks and fair catches, which left Rutgers "wholly outclassed" and on the losing end of the sport's first shutout, 8-0. The rubber match, scheduled for Rutgers, was never played. Already faculty at both schools had become alarmed at the passionate attention the new game generated among the students, and ordered the match canceled. Not two weeks after intercollegiate football was born, in other words, the faculty had concluded that it was drawing too much attention.</p><p>Nevertheless, games between colleges proved to be popular. The following year, 1870, Princeton won twice at home against Rutgers while Rutgers, in turn, introduced Columbia to the sport. Columbia's first captain was Stuyvesant Fish, son of President Ulysses S. Grant's Secretary of State. The Fishes were an old New York family, but it was soon apparent that there was no room for gentility on the football field. One Rutgers player, James Van Rensselaer Weston, later recalled, "While lying prostrate on the ground I saw Stuyvesant Fish, the Columbia giant, trying to jump over me. He landed with his No. 14's just grazing my cheek. As he was nearly as large and raw-boned as Abe Lincoln, I had a narrow escape." No intercollegiate games were played in 1871, but when Columbia met Rutgers again the following year, the teams agreed to an experiment in which a score could be made by kicking the ball over, rather than under, the crossbar of the goal.</p><p>Yale's intercollegiate football debut was the highlight of the 1872 season and one of the important moments in the history of the sport. Credit for reviving the game in New Haven goes to a student, David S. Schaff, who had spent a year studying at the Rugby School in England. Nevertheless, Yale played the soccer variety of football favored by other American colleges.</p><p>The Elis had hoped to arrange a game with Princeton, but faculty at both colleges refused to excuse their teams fr...</p></p><h2>Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 7)</h2><p>In the first installment of the Aurora Teagarden series, Real Murders, the small town of Lawrenceton, Georgia, was beset by a series of horrific murders. Librarian Aurora "Roe" Teagarden teamed up with true crime writer Robin Crusoe to catch the killer, and the results of their investigation have gone down in Lawrenceton history. <br><br>Now Robin is back in town, set to begin filming the movie version of the terrible events of so many years ago. Of course he's not alone-he brings with him a cast and crew the size of which nearly overwhelms the tiny excitement-starved town. Roe is disturbed to discover that the film's crew includes her stepson, who despises her, as well as an actress set to play her in the film. Everyone in Lawrenceton suddenly goes movie crazy, mentally composing awards-acceptance speeches while prancing around the fringes of the set awaiting discovery. <br><br>Roe's not so crazy about the whole thing...and neither is a secret, vicious murderer. When bodies start dropping, it's up to Roe to reprise her role as amateur sleuth and stop the carnage before it gets out of hand. It's no problem for the beloved small-town librarian in this wonderfully cozy installment in the adored Aurora Teagarden mystery series. <br></p><p>Charlaine Harris is also the author of the acclaimed Lily Bard mysteries, most recently <i>Shakespeare's Counselor</i>, and the award-nominated Southern vampire series, most recently, <i>Living Dead in Dallas</i>. Born in Mississippi, she now lives in Magnolia, Arkansas.<br><p>Chapter One</p><p>When I stopped at the end of the driveway to extract my letters and magazines from the mailbox, I never imagined that in five minutes I&#x2019;d be sitting at my kitchen table reading an article about myself. But my entertainment magazine had had a fascinating teaser on the cover: "Crusoe&#x2019;s Book Comes to the Screen (Finally)&#x2014;WHIMSICAL MURDERS Goes On Location." It had taken me only seconds to flip pages to the article, which was faced by a full-page picture of my former friend Robin Crusoe, his long frame folded into a chair behind a desk piled high with books. Then, with a much deeper sensation of shock, I realized that, in a green-shaded sidebar, the small woman walking to her car, head down, was me. Not surprisingly, I decided to read the sidebar first.</p><p>"It was a strangely jolting experience to see Aurora Tea-garden in the flesh," began the writer, one Marjory Bolton.</p><p>Strangely jolting, my tushy.</p><p>"The diminutive librarian, whose courage and perspicuity led to the discovery of the serial killers terrorizing Lawrenceton, Georgia, is no recluse."</p><p>Why would I be?</p><p>"Though only in her thirties, she&#x2019;s experienced more excitement than most women have in their lifetimes," I read, "and though she became a widow last November, Aurora Teagarden could pass for someone ten years her junior." Well, I kind of liked that. I could see the end of my thirties if I looked real hard. I wasn&#x2019;t looking.</p><p>"She comes to work at the Lawrenceton Library every day, driving her new Chevy." Would I drive someone else&#x2019;s? "Modest in dress and demeanor, Teagarden hardly appears to be the independently wealthy woman she is." Why would I wear designer originals (an inexplicable waste of money anyway) to my job at the library? This was absurdity.</p><p>I skimmed the remaining paragraphs, hoping to see something that made sense. Actually, I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded another reference to my youthful appearance. But no. "Though Teagarden refused to let the filmmakers use her name, the main female character in the script is widely held to be based on her persona. Teagarden&#x2019;s mother, Aida Queensland, a multimillion-dollar real estate salesperson, attributes her daughter&#x2019;s distancing herself from the project to Teagarden&#x2019;s aversion to the memories the incidents left and to Teagarden&#x2019;s deeply religious heritage."</p><p>I brought the cordless phone into the kitchen and hit an auto-dial number. "Mother, did you tell this Marjory Bolton that I came from a &#x2018;deeply religious heritage&#x2019;?" We hadn&#x2019;t even settled on the Episcopal Church until Mother had married John Queensland.</p><p>My mother had the grace to sound a little embarrassed as she said, "Good evening, Aurora. She asked me if we went to church, and I said yes."</p><p>I read through the paragraph again. "And you told her you were a multimillion-dollar real estate broker?"</p><p>"Well, I am. And I thought I might as well get in a plug for the business."</p><p>"Like you needed it!"</p><p>"Business could always be better. Besides, I&#x2019;m trying to get into the best position for selling the firm. One of these days I&#x2019;m going to retire."</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time in the past couple of months Mother had said something about selling Select Realty. Since John had had a heart attack, my mother had cut back on her work hours. Apparently, she&#x2019;d also begun to think about how much longer she wanted to work.</p><p>Two years ago, I&#x2019;d have sworn she&#x2019;d die while she was showing a house, but now I knew better. She&#x2019;d gotten a wake-up call.</p><p>"Listen to this," I said. " &#x2018;Ms. Teagarden, close friend of rising power-that-be Cartland Sewell, may have political plans. Some insiders regard her as a power behind the scenes in area politics.&#x2019; Who on earth could&#x2019;ve told them that? What a bunch of . . ."</p><p>"Aurora!" Mother warned.</p><p>"Codswallop," I finished. It was a word I&#x2019;d never had occasion to say out loud before.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sure it was Bubba himself," Mother said. She was more politically astute without trying than I would be if I had a fully briefed advisor.</p><p>"Really?" Even I could hear the wonderment in my voice.</p><p>She sighed. "I hope you never remotely consider running for office or backing any candidate you really want to win," she advised me. "And I&#x2019;ve got to try to remember to call him Cartland. After calling him Bubba for forty years, Cartland is a mouthful. He seems to think he has a better chance of getting elected if he goes by his christened name."</p><p>Well, I might not be politically astute like Bubba Sewell&#x2014;excuse me, Cartland Sewell&#x2014;but I could see that even my own mother had had a self-serving reason for contributing a quote to a completely unwanted, unnecessary magazine article about me.</p><p>"Have you finished the whole article?" Mother asked, and her voice had taken on some anxiety.</p><p>"No." That sounded ominous. I skipped over the last part of the sidebar, the part where my friend Angel Young-blood had shoved the photographer, and returned to the main body of the article, the reason for the revival of interest in yours truly.</p><p>"After a long and frustrating wait, the grisly tale of the murders upon which Robin Crusoe&#x2019;s book WHIMSICAL DEATH was based is coming to the small screen as a two-part miniseries. Filmmakers hope for a more successful pairing of true-crime book and movie than Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Crusoe&#x2019;s sojourn in Hollywood has made him skeptical of the result. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know how the natives of Lawrenceton will feel about the job we&#x2019;re doing,&#x2019; Crusoe admitted. &#x2018;I plan to be there for the location shoot.&#x2019; Crusoe has another reason to be on the scene; he&#x2019;s the constant companion of actress Celia Shaw, who will play the Teagarden character."</p><p>I flipped the page, just hoping. Yep, there it was&#x2014;a small shot of Robin and Celia Shaw at some movie premiere party. Celia had done an Emmy-winning guest stint on ER as a sexually addicted med student, and in this picture she and Robin were whooping it up with three of the cast members. My mouth dropped open. It was one thing to have known for the past several years that Robin was in Hollywood, writing his mystery novels from there while he touted the screenplay of his book, but it was another thing entirely to see him being Hollywood.</p><p>I examined Celia Shaw&#x2019;s face, the size of a fingernail, with a fascination I found hard to explain to myself. Of course, she really didn&#x2019;t look much like me, even like the Aurora of a few years ago. She was short, and she had notable cleavage, and her eyes were brown; those were the only points of similarity. Her face was narrower, her lips were plumper, and she had more of a nose. (I could hardly be said to have a nose at all.) And, of course, she wasn&#x2019;t wearing glasses. She was wearing a dress I wouldn&#x2019;t even have given a second glance to as I flicked through a rack. It was deep emerald green, had a sequined top, and plunged low.</p><p>I glanced down at my own cleavage, modestly covered by the tobacco brown twin set I&#x2019;d worn to work over khakis. I&#x2019;d look good in that dress (I told myself loyally), but I&#x2019;d be uncomfortable the entire time.</p><p>Not that I could imagine going to any occasion where that dress would be appropriate. A few Lawrencetonians mixed in Atlanta society, as our small town came closer and closer to being absorbed in the urban sprawl of the South&#x2019;s great city, but I was not one of them; nor had I ever wanted to be.</p><p>I&#x2019;d never really enjoyed the social functions I had to attend or arrange as Martin&#x2019;s wife, and they&#x2019;d been relatively modest. As the head of the large Pan-Am Agra plant, Martin had had many obligations, only some of them related to actually running the plant.</p><p>When I looked back on the two years we&#x2019;d been married, the evenings seemed a blur of entertaining higher-ups from out of town, potential customers, and representatives from the bigger accounts. We&#x2019;d been invited to every charity event in Lawrenceton, and not a few in Atlanta. I&#x2019;d bought the appropriate clothes, worn them, and smiled through it all, but those social evenings hadn&#x2019;t been much fun. Coming home with Martin had been the good part.</p><p>Coming home with Martin had been worth every minute of that social tedium.</p><p>And with that memory, the heaviness I carried inside me every moment of every day came crashing back down. I actually felt the misery descend.</p><p>Until I&#x2019;d thought about the article, been distracted for a few minutes, I hadn&#x2019;t realized how grievous a burden I was carrying: it was the weight of my widowhood.</p><p>As abruptly as it had engaged my interest, the magazine article repelled me. There would be strangers swarming around my hometown, strangers who were interested in me without caring about me. All the horror of those old deaths would be raked up. At least a few townspeople would be made miserable, as the deaths of their loved ones were reenacted for the titillation of whomever had a television set. There was no way to stop this from happening, apparently&#x2014;no way to keep the curtain of privacy drawn around me. Already, in a national magazine, I was being depicted as mysterious, odd, and somewhat boring.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want this movie to be made, and I didn&#x2019;t want those people here.</p><p>As I&#x2019;d thought, there were a few people in Lawrenceton who were as glum as I was over the prospect of entertaining a film company. One of them was the aforementioned Bubba&#x2014;excuse me, Cartland&#x2014;Sewell&#x2019;s wife, my friend Lizanne. Her parents were among the victims of the pair of serial killers who had caused us all tremendous grief. Lizanne, too, had read the magazine article, I discovered later that evening.</p><p>Lizanne said, "Roe, I imagine Bubba&#x2019;s boosterism got in the way of his common sense." Beautiful Lizanne has always been a tranquil woman, resolutely uninvolved in any town intrigues, and for the past two years her attention had been narrowly focused on her children, two boys she&#x2019;d named Brandon and Davis. Brandon was eighteen months old, and Davis had just turned three months, so Lizanne had her hands full. In the course of our choppy telephone conversation, we were constantly interrupted. Bubba, Lizanne told me, was at a bar association meeting. I fumed at not being able to speak my mind to Bubba, but I would have settled for a nice chat with Lizanne. But in five minutes, Brandon&#x2019;s shrieking and the wails of the baby reached such a peak that Lizanne excused herself.</p><p>While I washed my few dishes that cool October evening, I found myself wondering which of the unfamiliar faces in the library in recent weeks had belonged to the magazine writer. You&#x2019;d think a writer for an L.A.-based entertainment weekly would have stood out like a sore thumb in our library. But the dress of our culture has become so universal, it isn&#x2019;t as easy to spot outsiders as it used to be.</p><p>It struck me as particularly nasty that this woman had been able to come and stare at me and dissect me, while I&#x2019;d been totally unaware. She&#x2019;d said I&#x2019;d turned down a request for an interview. That was so automatic that I actually might not have remembered it. But how could I have been oblivious to the fact that I was under observation? I must have been even more preoccupied than I&#x2019;d thought.</p><p>Being a widow was a full-time occupation, at least emotionally.</p><p>Everyone (that is, my mother and her husband John, and most of my friends) had expected me to move back into town after my husband&#x2019;s death. Our house, a gift to me from Martin when we&#x2019;d married, was a little isolated, and too large for one person. But from my point of view, I&#x2019;d loved the man and I loved my home. I couldn&#x2019;t lose both at once.</p><p>So I stayed in the house that had been known for years as the Julius house. When Martin had given it to me, I&#x2019;d renovated it from the bottom up, and I kept it up well, though now I had to have more help in that keeping. Shelby Youngblood, Angel&#x2019;s husband and a close friend of my husband&#x2019;s, had offered to come out and do the mowing, but I&#x2019;d turned him down gently. I knew Shelby, with his own yard and house and baby, had plenty to do when he had a couple of days off work. I&#x2019;d hired a yard service to do most of the heavier work, but every now and then I got out and put in bedding plants, or trimmed the roses.</p><p>With less justification than the yard service, I&#x2019;d also hired a maid. Martin had always wanted me to have help in the house, but I&#x2019;d felt perfectly capable of taking care of the house and cooking, though I was working at least part-time most of our marriage. Now, oddly, I was seized with the determination that the house should always look immaculate. It was as if I was going to show it to a prospective buyer any moment. I had even cleaned out all the closets. Where my new passion for absolute order and cleanliness had come from, why it possessed me, I could not tell you. The maid (whose identity kept changing&#x2014;at the moment it was a heavy older woman named Catherine Quick) came in once a week and did all the heavy clean-ing&#x2014;the bathrooms, the kitchen, the dusting, and the vac-uuming&#x2014;while I did everything else. I didn&#x2019;t suffer a smudge on the kitchen floor or an unwashed sock. Even though only one upstairs bedroom, the downstairs study, one bathroom, and the kitchen were in any kind of regular use, I kept this regimen up month after month.</p><p>I guess I was a little crazy: or, since I could afford a slightly kinder word, eccentric.</p><p>As I trudged up the stairs to go to bed that night, I wondered, for the first time, if keeping the house hadn&#x2019;t been a mistake.</p><p>Opening the bedroom door still gave me a little shock. One thing I had changed, a couple of months after Martin died, was our bedroom. Once fairly masculine and centered around the king-sized bed, now the big room was peach and ivory and fawn, the bed was a queen, and the furniture was more ornate. Atop the chest of drawers, there was a picture of Martin and me at our wedding. That picture was all that was bearable.</p><p>I looked at it for a long moment as I pulled off my rings and put them in a pile in front of the frame. I added my watch to the little heap before I climbed into the high bed and switched on the lamp, stretching a little further to reach the switch to flick off the overhead light. I picked up the book I was reading (though for months I hadn&#x2019;t remembered a word of any book I read) and had completed just a page when the telephone rang. I glanced at the clock and frowned.</p><p>"Yes?" I said curtly into the receiver.</p><p>"Roe?" The voice was familiar, tentative and masculine.</p><p>"Who is this?" I asked.</p><p>"Ahhhh . . . it&#x2019;s Robin?"</p><p>"Oh, great. Just the guy I wanted to talk to," I said, my voice saturated with sarcasm. But way down deep, I found I was really glad to hear his voice.</p><p>"You&#x2019;ve seen the article. Listen, I didn&#x2019;t write that article, and I didn&#x2019;t know it was going to be in the magazine, and I had nothing to do with it."</p><p>"Right."</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from Last Scene Alive by Charlaine Harris.<br>Copyright 2002 by Charlaine Harris.<br>Published in August 2002 by St. Martin s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

It is some time since she helped out her old admirer and adversary, Chief Inspector Hunter Cowgill, and she misses the excitement. When the call comes from Cowgill, asking her for help once more, she hardly hesitates, and so Lois is plunged into a web of mystery, bigotry and intrigue.</p><p>Ann Purser lives in England.For Anglophiles and fans of the British cozy, Purser's latest entry in her Lois Mead series is just the ticket. The book, which is liberally sprinkled with wry British humor, offers a realistic look at English village life and the travails of a typical English working-class family. Lois has been busy managing her successful housecleaning business since her last encounter with policeman Hunter Cowgill (when she helped solve the kidnapping of two neighbors).Now Cowgill wants Lois' help to uncover a local gang of Satanists. Lois already has plenty to worry about--her mother suffers a life-threatening case of flu, and not one but two of her employees appear to be having an affair with the vicar's godson. But her troubles pale when the parish verger dies in mysterious circumstances and a fire at the local vicarage kills the vicar's godson. Suspicion points to the Satanists. Clever, engaging, and suspenseful, this is Purser's best Lois Mead adventure yet. Recommend it heartily to all village cozy fans. <i>Emily Melton</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Juan Serrano is one of the world&#39;s premier flamenco concert soloist and is a seasoned teacher and performer in this vibrant, colorful musical genre. The text describes the history and development of flamenco music; teaches basic music theory; presents developmental studies on flamenco guitar techniques such as rasgueado and tremolo; and offers 14 exciting flamenco guitar solos. Written in notation and tablature.</p><p>Juan Serrano's incredible musical execution has been witnessed and enjoyed by millions around the world. Serrano has drawn awe and praise from his audiences, aficionados, critics, and artistic peers. Critics have called him the "best flamenco guitarist living today." <p>But Juan Serrano is more than just an incredibly gifted guitarist. He is also an exceptional and rare musical resource who can communicate his art on a very personal level unlike other great Spanish guitarists who normally only perform in a strict concert setting where the audience receives little orientation about flamenco from the artist. Serrano speaks both English and Spanish which enables him to give enlightening explanations during his performances that give his audiences a rare insight into flamenco. He has performed on major television and radio programs throughout the world. In addition, Serrano has authored several music books and videos distributed by Mel Bay Publications which instruct guitar players on the origins of flamenco and its techniques. He has also written Flamenco, Body and Soul, a history of flamenco for the aficionado published by the Press at California State University. </p><p>Serrano's mastery of flamenco not only comes from his many years of discipline and study of the guitar, but also because he grew up in Cordoba, Spain, the birthplace of this rich and dazzling music. At age nine, Serrano was studying under his father, a professional guitarist, and learning the traditions of flamenco which is a fusion of Jewish, Moorish, Christian and Gypsy musical elements between the 8th and 15th centuries in Andalucia. Juan made his professional debut at age 13 and as a teenage earned a reputation all over Spain and Europe as a gifted musician. He performed and recorded with the top flamenco musical, dance, and theatrical companies. At this time Serrano also started his solo career. His home town of Cordoba was so proud of his accomplishments that they replaced the bell in the town clock with recordings of his guitar playing. </p><p>Cordoba also awarded Serrano the Porto de Oro. This prestigious honor is awarded once every ten years and Serrano is the only guitarist ever to be so honored. Serrano received the Page One Ball from the Newspaper Guild of New York for his outstanding performances. He was also awarded the Medalla de Oro from the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts, the Catedra de Flamencologia from Jerez, Spain, and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut. The city of Fresno bestowed Serrano with the "Fabulous Fresnan" and "Horizon" awards. Serrano is the only flamenco guitarist in the world with a doctorate in humane letters and a tenured faculty position at a major university. He developed the guitar program at California State University and heads the guitar department. In addition to his teaching duties, Serrano is much sought after as a performer, for master classes and as a guest lecturer on the history of flamenco. Serrano's latest recordings are a series of five compact discs, Masters of Flamenco, Volumes 1-5 and The Art of Flamenco Guitar released by Planet Records; Flamenco Festival, a re-release by BMG; Grandes Guitarras by Phillips; and Sabor Flamenco released by Concord Picante.</p></p><h2>Above the Lines: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914-1918</h2><p>This work contains the biographies of the aces of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps.

Though she threw herself into the study of bog bodies and the mysteries of their circumstances, she was ultimately led back to the one mystery she was unable to solve: the murder of her sister, Tr�ona. Nora can&#x2019;t move forward until she goes back&#x2014;back to her home, to the scene of the crime, to the source of her nightmares and her deepest regrets. </p><p>Determined to put her sister&#x2019;s case to rest and anxious about her eleven-year-old niece, Elizabeth, Nora returns to Saint Paul, Minnesota, to find that her brother-in-law, Peter Hallett, is about to remarry and has plans to leave the country with his new bride. Nora has long suspected Hallett in Tr�ona&#x2019;s murder, though there has never been any proof of his involvement, and now she believes that his new wife and Elizabeth may both be in danger. Time is short, and as Nora begins reinvestigating her sister&#x2019;s death, missed clues and ever-more disturbing details come to light. What is the significance of the "false mermaid" seeds found on Tr�ona&#x2019;s body? Why was her behavior so erratic in the days before her murder? </p><p>Is there a link between Tr�ona&#x2019;s death and that of another young woman? </p><p>Nora&#x2019;s search for answers takes her from the banks of the Mississippi to the cliffs of Ireland, where the eerie story of a fisherman&#x2019;s wife who vanished more than a century ago offers up uncanny parallels.

Seng Sotharith pulled his line taut and played the fish, sensing in the animal&#x2019;s erratic movements its furious refusal to give in. He would do the same, he thought&#x2014;had done the same, when he was caught. </p><p>Sotharith sat on the crooked trunk of an enormous cottonwood that leaned out over the water and watched the river flow by. Sometimes as he sat here, suspended above the water, he whispered the words over and over again, intrigued by their strangeness on his tongue. <i>Minnesota. Mississippi</i>. He had been in America a long time&#x2014;five years in California, and now nearly eight years with his cousin&#x2019;s family in Saint Paul, but still the music of the language eluded him. </p><p>High above on the bluffs, the noises of the city droned, but here he could shut them out. Sometimes on foggy mornings, he looked across the water and felt himself back in Cambodia. He saw houses on stilts, heard the shouts of his older brothers as they played and splashed in the river. The pictures never lasted long, dissipating quickly with the mist. Now the sun was rising behind him, gilding the leaves on the opposite bank. Soon he would have to scale the steep bluff and get to his job at the restaurant. All afternoon and evening, deaf to the shouts and noise of the kitchen, he would wash dishes, wrapped in his thoughts and in memories that billowed through his head like the clouds of steam that rose from the sinks. </p><p>He had once harbored a secret ambition to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps and become a doctor. Now, nearly forty years old, he knew it was far too late. But he was determined to learn English at least, to conquer its strange sounds and even stranger writing. It was the one way he could bring honor to his father&#x2019;s memory. </p><p>Sotharith concentrated on his fish, letting the creature run one last time before reeling it in. Coming here helped clear away the images from his dreams, the tangled arms and legs he stepped through every night, the expanse of skulls covering the ground like cobblestones. </p><p>When he first arrived in Saint Paul, his cousin had brought him to a doctor, a gray-haired woman with kind eyes. She asked him to speak about the bones, but he could not. No words would come. They all looked at him&#x2014;his cousin, the interpreter, the doctor. She tried to tell him that he had nothing to worry about, that he was safe here in America. He repeated the English word inside his head: <i>safe</i>. No matter how many times he said it, the sound meant nothing to him. Sotharith only knew that he had to climb down to this riverbank as often as he could, to walk the woods and sandbars below the green canopy and hear the birds at first light. </p><p>His catch was finally tiring. Sotharith stood and edged his way down the cottonwood&#x2019;s broad trunk and landed the fish in the shallows beside its exposed and twisted roots. It was time to go. He gathered his sandals and the rest of his gear and headed to the place where he cleaned his fish, a pool in a marshy clearing just below the bluff. </p><p>When he reached the place, Sotharith took out his knife, giving the blade a few sharpening swipes against a small oval whetstone he kept in his pocket. The flash from the knife fell upon a bunch of red berries growing a few feet away. Sotharith set the knife aside and crawled toward the fruit that hung like tiny jewels, bright crimson against the dry leaves. He plucked one berry, biting into its sweet-and-bitter flesh, the taste of survival. Then he lifted the fish from the basket and cleaned it with a practiced hand, slitting open its pale belly and clearing the shiny, slippery viscera from between the ribs with one finger as he watched the light in its staring eyes go out. </p><p><i>The sun was barely up, but already the heat&#x2014;and the smell&#x2014;were almost overwhelming. They were being marched across a muddy field littered with bodies, and although he tried not to, he could not avoid stepping on them. The soldiers ahead stopped for some reason, and they heard voices raised in argument.</i>Get down, <i>his father whispered suddenly.</i>Get down and be still. <i>He&#x2019;d felt a hand pressing on his shoulder, and had done as his father commanded, slipping down between the still-warm bodies, and trying not to look into their unseeing eyes. He felt a cold, lifeless hand laid across his face, then heard the orders barked at his father and the others, and felt icy terror as they moved on without him. He did not make a sound. A few moments later he heard the soldiers call a halt. No shots followed, no shouting, just the distant, dull sound of blows and bodies falling, and a single faint cry, abruptly cut short. It hadn&#x2019;t taken long; by then the killing had become habit.</i> </p><p>Everything was less clear when he tried to remember what came after, how long he had lain among the dead, waiting for a chance to escape, or all the days and weeks he&#x2019;d spent hiding in the jungle, catching rainwater as it fell from palm fronds, eating the fruit he could gather, insects and grubs he dug out of the ground, whatever he could find. Time lost all measure; it seemed that he had lived with the birds and the monkeys for years before the soldiers caught him and sent him to the camps. It had taken another kind of will to survive there. </p><p>Here in America, he had always felt the mark of death upon him, a stain where that cold hand had touched his face. </p><p>He washed the fish blood from his hands in the pool of spring water that rose up from the forest floor. After cleaning fish, he always took care to bury the entrails. He&#x2019;d chosen this spot not just for the spring, but because the earth around it was soft&#x2014;easy to dig. With one hand, he cleared away dead leaves; with the other, he picked up a broken branch to use as a tool. At first, the ground yielded easily, coming up in irregular clods. Then his makeshift hoe snagged on something. Rocking forward on his knees, he pulled harder, tugging the branch to one side and then the other, and felt the earth erupt beneath him as the object suddenly came loose. He tumbled backward, tasting a shower of rotting leaves and feeling dry branches snap under his weight. Sotharith raised himself on his elbows and looked down to see what he had unearthed. </p><p>On the ground between his feet rested a human skull, its cheekbones cracked and splintered, empty eyeholes staring. Sotharith could only stare back, not daring to breathe. Inside his chest, he felt a slow resurrection of the knowledge that he had carried within him for so long. There was no safe place, not even here. The killing fields were everywhere. </p><p>� 2010 Erin Hart</p></p><h2>Saving Lives in Auschwitz: The Prisoners&#x2019; Hospital in Buna-Monowitz</h2><p><p>In a 1941 Nazi roundup of educated Poles, Stefan Budziaszek&#x2015;newly graduated from medical school in Krakow&#x2015;was incarcerated in the Krakow Montelupich Prison and transferred to the Auschwitz concentration camp in February 1942. German big businesses brutally exploited the cheap labor of prisoners in the camp, and workers were dying. In 1943, Stefan, now a functionary prisoner, was put in charge of the on-site prisoner hospital, which at the time was more like an infirmary staffed by well-connected but untrained prisoners. Stefan transformed this facility from just two barracks into a working hospital and outpatient facility that employed more than 40 prisoner doctors and served a population of 10,000 slave laborers.</p> <p> Stefan and his staff developed the hospital by commandeering medication, surgical equipment, and even building materials, often from the so-called Canada warehouse filled with the effects of Holocaust victims. But where does seeking the cooperation of the Nazi concentration camp staff become collusion with Nazi genocide? How did physicians deal with debilitated patients who faced &#x201c;selection&#x201d; for transfer to the gas chambers? Auschwitz was a cauldron of competing agendas. Unexpectedly, ideological rivalry among prisoners themselves manifested itself as well. Prominent Holocaust witnesses Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi both sought treatment at this prisoner hospital. They, other patients, and hospital staff bear witness to the agency of prisoner doctors in an environment better known for death than survival.</p><br></p><p>Dr. Ewa K.

Written by the daughter of the prisoner physician who transformed and built up this hospital, the account is remarkable for its combination of scholarly objectivity and personal involvement. Using extensive primary material, including the oral testimony of her father, the author illuminates the moral ambiguities and political complexities of the &#x2018;grey zone&#x2019; in which prisoner physicians had to operate, needing as they did to cooperate with the SS while attempting to protect and save the lives of fellow inmates.&#x201d; </p> (Mary Fulbrook, University College London)</p><h2>Digesting the Universe: A Revolutionary Framework for Healthy Metabolism Function</h2><p>What if the solution to overcoming serious health challenges, like those of metabolic syndrome, is hiding in plain sight?

The first excavations took place in 1980, but it was not until 1984 that any significant dinosaur remains were found. Originally, most of those engaged in the excavation of fossils were amateurs. A large amount of equipment was utilized to burrow into a cliff where the sediments of an ancient stream channel were preserved. By the second year of exploration, the site at Dinosaur Cove was better organized, and almost 10 tons of fossiliferous rock were excavated. From 1986 to 1991, many of those engaged in excavations were Earthwatch volunteers from the US. Much tunneling had to be undertaken at the various sites under study, and at times high tides would inundate the sites. Eventually, five new genera of Hypsilophodontidae were found. A long description is offered of dating methods for recovered fossils. Excavation sites are isolated so everything necessary for digging has to be transported there, necessitating complex logistical arrangements.

Answer: The Siren, a legendary Crown Jewel that Fiona has targeted for her next heist. It's said to be worth millions, but to Christophe it's invaluable. For the Siren also happens to be one of the missing jewels from Poseidon's trident. But breaking into the Tower of London is a two-person job, and Christophe and Fiona must team up to commit the crime of the century.<br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p>Alyssa Day is the pen name (and dark and tortured alter ego) of Alesia Holliday, winner of Romance Writers of America&#39;s prestigious RITA award for excellence in romance fiction.

Several clicking noises sounded directly beneath and in front of where he hung, suspended, and he turned his attention downward.</p><p>Toward the . . . <i>ninja</i>.</p><p>Which startled him enough that he released his mist form, plummeted down from the ceiling, and landed on his ass. &#x201c;What in the nine hells&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The figure in scarlet whirled around and Christophe was treated to two more surprises: the shiny, deadly looking gun and the lovely curve of scarlet-covered breasts and hips.</p><p>The Scarlet Ninja was a woman&#x2014;and she was armed.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Who in the bloody hell are you and where did you come from?&#x201d; Fiona glared at the intruder, her gaze traveling up and up as he slowly stood, holding his hands out in front of him. He was a few inches over six feet of tall, dark, and sinfully gorgeous, and he had no right to be here in the middle of her scouting trip, never mind those astonishingly muscled shoulders and the dark waves of hair framing the most beautiful green eyes, sculpted cheekbones, and deliciously masculine face she had ever seen on a living, breathing man. Her breathing sped up, and her heart, which had already been racing faster than the lead car in the Birmingham Super Prix, thundered so hard it surely would pound its way out of her chest any moment.</p><p>She was a thief, standing in the middle of one of the most priceless collections of gems in the entire world, and yet she wasn&#x2019;t tempted to look anywhere but at him.</p><p>Oh, yes. He was trouble.</p><p>Trouble blinked; long, dark lashes closing over emerald-green eyes so gorgeous they had to be illegal in most of Europe. Then he threw back his head and laughed, and shivers traced a delicate pattern down her spine. His deep, rich laugh was dark chocolate and champagne and silk sheets all presented in one wickedly mouthwatering package.</p><p>Oh, damn, it had been far too long since she&#x2019;d had sex.</p><p>Her watch beeped. Glancing down, she saw that she had twelve minutes. Declan had hacked into the security cameras and put them on a circular repeating pattern or something equally complex and brilliant, but he&#x2019;d warned her a dozen times that she had exactly fifteen minutes and not a second more.</p><p>She raised the tranq gun and used her best frosty, lady-of-the-manor voice. &#x201c;I repeat, who in the bloody hell are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Scottish,&#x201d; he said, quite unnecessarily.</p><p>&#x201c;Give the man a gold ring. You have ten seconds to tell me who you are and why you&#x2019;re here before I shoot you.&#x201d; She raised the gun, hoping the first time she had to shoot a man while looking him in the eyes wouldn&#x2019;t haunt her dreams for months to come. But needs must and, well, the Siren was waiting, no matter how mouthwateringly delicious this man might be.</p><p>&#x201c;The Scarlet Ninja is a woman. A Scottish woman,&#x201d; he said, his gaze sweeping over her from head to toe, blistering every inch of skin under her garments, as if the heat in his eyes were a palpable touch.</p><p>Of course, the negative here was that he appeared to be a blithering idiot.</p></p><h2>Camping With the Corps of Engineers: The complete guide to campgrounds built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</h2><p>Corps of Engineers campgrounds are regarded as the best public camping areas in America.

Refusing sentimentality and realism, she shows how personal devastation can feel, to the sufferer, as powerful and enduring as myth.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Smartly innovative, lushly poetic, compellingly told, and truly moving,&nbsp;<em>Fish in Exile</em>&nbsp;is a remarkable, sui generis novel. Vi Khi Nao is a strikingly talented writer whose artistic vision takes many literary forms. I ardently hope she does more long form fiction; she does it splendidly.&#x201d; &#x2014;<strong>Robert Olen Butler</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The result is a novel that forges a new vocabulary for the routine of grief, as well as the process of healing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly,&nbsp;</em>starred review</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Nao, who was born in Vietnam, blends prose and poetry in her heart-wrenching novel about a couple grieving for their two dead children.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;BBC</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;[Nao&#x2019;s] sentences roll in and surround like a thick fog, dampening, chilling, becoming in certain moments, wholly iridescent.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Boston Globe</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;An off-kilter but effective tone poem on loss and recovery.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Told in alternating perspectives, fragments, reports, stage-play format, footnotes, reimagined Greek myths and, at one point, a drawing,&nbsp;<em>Fish in Exile</em>&nbsp;manipulates form as a means to exploring its themes thoroughly.&#x201d; &#x2014;<strong><em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This journey across the boundaries of form and genre, to write about what is un-write-aboutable, is a smart maneuver&#x2014;it permits the reader to experience what has been written about over and over in a way that is fresh and absorbing in its difference.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;NPR</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;...Nao&#x2019;s depiction of grief doesn&#x2019;t read artificial or overworked, but true, painful and occasionally completely confusing. Nao&#x2019;s novel is not a conventional story, but an experience of what it is like to live with the pain of loss.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Daily Texan</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Vi Khi Nao seems the elusive love child of Anne Carson and Samuel Beckett, a preposterous connection that, somehow, in the end, makes a lot of sense.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Star Tribune</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;[<em>Fish in Exile</em>] highlights the patriarchy&#x2019;s utter inability to fully understand or appreciate motherhood, the biological imperatives that form the foundation of parenthood, and the acceptance of the notion that grief can never really be extinguished, only embraced as part of the human experience.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Angel City Review</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The impressions that last, however, will be entirely Nao&#x2019;s own: all the wondrous forms she has revealed to us, the image of them luminescent, flourishing, in the seemingly dark and empty waters of grief.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Harvard Crimson</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Vi Khi Nao has created a meditation that splits open the numbing and disorienting problems of loss and mourning with language that breathes new life into an old suffering.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Millions</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Fish in Exile</em>&nbsp;is a stunning novel that examines how easily we can fall apart after a disaster. . . . Indeed, the traditional narrative of loss disappears in the capable hands of Vi Khi Nao and we are left with a powerful and devastating story that is surprising in the best ways.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;diaCRITICS</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Fish in Exile</em> melts traditional academic narrative with magic and folklore, creating an unforgettable story that reminds the reader there is no universally correct approach to dealing with grief.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Rumpus</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;A magical and fresh perspective on grief, this beautiful book is like nothing you've ever read before.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Bustle</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It's an extreme feat of economy and vision that Vi Khi Nao was able to so robustly depict the aftermath of the death of one's child in such a fascinating and exciting set of sentences and logic as she has in <em>Fish in Exile.</em>&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Vice</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;A staggering tale of the death of a child, this novel is a poetic meditation on loss, the fluidity of boundaries, and feeling like a fish out of water.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Millions</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Through mythic tangents and arrest, Nao pulls us through dismemberment, dissociation, and devotion with colossal sentences.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Fanzine</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;When you open the first pages of <em>Fish in Exile,</em> it is clear: you are conversing with a poet. . . . Reading this novel is like diving under the surface of the ocean, and sinking, deeper and deeper, until you are somehow deposited back on dry land.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Heavy Feather Review</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The language ranges from frank gallows humor to unexpectedly devastating, as if you&#x2019;re at a party exchanging sarcastic witticisms with a stranger and then she suddenly hits you over the head with a brick.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Rejectionist</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;[F]or all the weightiness of its subject matter, <em>Fish in Exile</em> is also surprisingly light on its feet: eccentric, absurd, and delightfully wry. This book wriggles with so much originality and life, it'll have you hooked from the very start.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;BuzzFeed Books Newsletter</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Fish in Exile</em> is that rare thing: a piece of art that transports you to an atmosphere you&#x2019;ve never breathed. It is a sensitive exploration of the impossibility and, ultimately, the inevitability, of beginning to live again after shattering loss.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Totally Dublin</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Occupying a myriad of spaces and spanning genres and mediums, Nao&#x2019;s work is a multi-faceted examination of the intersecting spaces of the religious, the corporeal, the industrial, and the pastoral.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Stutzwrites</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Vi Khi Nao&#x2019;s language isn&#x2019;t made of words like everyone else&#x2019;s. This can&#x2019;t be true, so it must be that Vi Khi Nao has found a way to sensitize words into a phase change, into a state of semantic overflow. Nao&#x2019;s sentences proceed via floral, clitoral, littoral surges.&nbsp;<em>Fish in Exile</em>&nbsp;is what leaks from the forms literary grief has taken, and what floats away, an amalgam of jellyfish and clouds. I love this book for its texture, its granular absurdities, its aqueous erotics, its garlic paper longing.&nbsp;I&#x2019;ve never felt anything like it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Joanna Ruocco</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Vi Khi Nao&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Fish in Exile</em>&nbsp;resonates with the unconscious fecundity of myth. A modern allegory of children who give birth to their mother, minnows that push a whale&#x2019;s shopping cart around Walmart, and hospitals that exude an odor of insane asylums and Windex: Demeter, Callisto, Catholic, and Ethos live again in Nao&#x2019;s world, and make new the most fundamental contradictions of life&#x2014;separation, desire, bondage, freedom, loyalty, birth.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Steve Tomasula</strong></p></p><h2>You&#39;ve Got To Be Kidding, Snoopy (Selected Cartoons From Speak Softly And Carry A Beagle, Volume 1)</h2><p>Selected Cartoons From Speak Softly And Carry A Beagle, Volume 1.</p><p></p><h2>Winslows of Careswell in Marshfield</h2><p>This revised and expanded edition of The Winslows of Careswell in Marshfield introduces the most recent research about Pilgrim Edward Winslow and his descendants who lived in Marshfield on their Careswell estate.</p><p></p><h2>U.S. Aircraft Carriers in Action, Part 1 (Warships)</h2><p>This book recounts the history of aircraft carriers and contains black and white photos and illustrations of the carriers Langley, Lexington, Ranger, Yorktown and Wasp.
